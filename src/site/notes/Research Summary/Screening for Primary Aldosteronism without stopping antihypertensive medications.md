**1. Title of the Article:**  

Performance of Aldosterone-to-renin Ratio Before Washout of Antihypertensive Drugs in Screening of Primary Aldosteronism  

  

**2. First Two Authors Followed by et al:**  

Xinyu Liu, Sufang Hao et al.  

  

**3. One-Line Summary of the Article:**  

The study evaluates the performance of aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) as a sensitive and specific screening test for primary aldosteronism (PA) without discontinuing antihypertensive drugs.  

  

**4. Six Key Points from the Article:**  

1. **Background**: PA is a common, treatable form of secondary hypertension, with ARR being the standard screening test. However, drug washout is often required, posing clinical risks.  

2. **Objective**: Assess the efficacy of ARR screening without discontinuation of antihypertensive medications.  

3. **Study Design**: Retrospective analysis of 1,306 patients screened for PA, comparing ARR before and after drug washout.  

4. **Key Findings**: At a cutoff of 0.7 (ng/dL)/(μIU/mL), ARR before washout showed 96.3% sensitivity, 61.2% specificity, 0.33 PPV, and 0.99 NPV.  

5. **Subgroup Analysis**: Sensitivity was higher in patients on β-blockers (98.3%) compared to those not on β-blockers (93.9%).  

6. **Conclusion**: ARR without drug washout is a reliable screening tool for PA, with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity.  

  

**5. Practical Take-Home Message:**  

ARR can be effectively used for screening PA without stopping antihypertensive drugs, minimizing the risk of complications associated with drug withdrawal. A cutoff of ≤0.7 (ng/dL)/(μIU/mL) reliably excludes PA, simplifying patient management.
