### **Summary of the Article**

**1. Title of the article**  
*Trabecular Bone Score in Asian-Indian Post-menopausal Women Across the Spectrum of Hyperglycaemia: Insights from a Cross-Sectional Study*

**2. First two Authors followed by et al.**  
Tanushi Aggarwal, Ravi Shah *et al.*

**3. One line summary of the article**  
TBS is significantly lower in post-menopausal women with T2DM compared to non-diabetics, despite similar aBMD, indicating its utility in assessing fracture risk.

**4. Six key points from the article**  
1. aBMD did not differ significantly among T2DM, pre-diabetes, and normoglycaemic groups, but TBS was significantly lower in T2DM women.  
2. TBS negatively correlated with HbA1c (r = −0.315) and duration of diabetes (r = −0.197), indicating worse bone microarchitecture with poor glycemic control and longer disease duration.  
3. TBS-adjusted FRAX scores predicted higher fracture risk compared to unadjusted FRAX in T2DM patients.  
4. Adjusting FRAX with TBS led to a 33% increase in the number of individuals qualifying for osteoporosis treatment per ISBMR guidelines.  
5. No significant difference in TBS was seen between pre-diabetic and normoglycaemic groups.  
6. TBS may offer superior risk stratification over aBMD in post-menopausal women with T2DM for fragility fractures.

**5. Practical take home message**  
In post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes, TBS should be considered alongside aBMD to more accurately evaluate bone quality and fracture risk, especially when conventional measures appear normal.
