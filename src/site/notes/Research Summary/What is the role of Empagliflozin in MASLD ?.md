# What is the role of Empagliflozin in MASLD ?


> [!note|+green]+ Created/Updated: #feb2025  


### **Title of the Article:**  
Effect of Empagliflozin on Liver Fat in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial (E-LIFT Trial)  

### **First Two Authors Followed by et al.:**  
Mohammad Shafi Kuchay, Sonal Krishan et al.  

### **One-Line Summary of the Article:**  
This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that empagliflozin significantly reduces liver fat and improves ALT levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  

### **Six Key Points from the Article:**  
1. **Study Objective:** Investigated the effect of empagliflozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor) on liver fat in type 2 diabetes and NAFLD using MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF).  
2. **Study Design:** A 20-week, open-label, randomized controlled trial with 50 patients, comparing empagliflozin (10 mg/day) plus standard diabetes treatment vs. standard treatment alone.  
3. **Primary Outcome:** Empagliflozin significantly reduced liver fat (MRI-PDFF decrease from 16.2% to 11.3%; p < 0.0001), while the control group showed a nonsignificant reduction (16.4% to 15.5%; p = 0.057).  
4. **Liver Enzymes:** ALT levels decreased significantly with empagliflozin (p = 0.005), whereas changes in AST (p = 0.212) and GGT (p = 0.057) were nonsignificant.  
5. **Glycemic Control Maintained:** Both groups had comparable reductions in fasting glucose and HbA1c, suggesting the liver fat reduction was independent of glycemic improvement.  
6. **Safety Profile:** Empagliflozin was well-tolerated, though a few patients experienced mild adverse effects, including balanoposthitis, fatigue, and joint pain.  

### **Practical Take-Home Message:**  
Empagliflozin, in addition to standard diabetes therapy, significantly reduces liver fat and improves ALT levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. These findings support its potential role in managing NAFLD alongside glycemic control.
