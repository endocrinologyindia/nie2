1. Title: Heterophilic Interference of Rheumatoid Factor in TSH Immunometric Assay: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study
    
2. Authors: Shaikh N. Nayeemuddin, Akash Panigrahi et al.
    
3. One-line summary: This study aimed to investigate whether rheumatoid factor (RF) causes heterophilic interference in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) immunoassays in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
    
4. Six key points: 

i. 84 newly diagnosed RF-positive RA patients underwent TSH, free T4, anti-TPO, and four tests to screen for TSH interference (chemiluminescence technique (CLIA) on Siemens Immulite 1000 platform)
ii. 10 samples showed loss of linearity on dilution studies, indicating potential interference. 
iii. 5 cases exhibited interference after heterophile blocker treatment. 
iv. 1 patient had diagnostic interpretation discordance on a second assay platform. 
v. No sample on polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation suggested antibody interference. vi. In most cases, the suspected interference did not affect clinical decision-making.
    
5. Practical take-home message: RF can cause heterophilic interference in commercial TSH immunoassays, which can be identified through dilution studies or heterophile blocker treatment. However, this interference does not significantly impact clinical decision-making in most situations.
