**### Title of the Article:**

Role of Inhibin B, AMH, GnRHa Test, and HCG Stimulation Test to Distinguish Isolated Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (IHH) from Constitutional Delay in Growth and Puberty (CDGP)

### One-line Summary of the Article:

This study evaluates the diagnostic utility of various hormonal tests to differentiate between isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP) in children.

  

### Six Key Points from the Article:

1. **Diagnosis Criteria**: Delayed puberty is characterized by the absence of testicular enlargement by age 14 in boys and lack of breast development by age 13 in girls.

2. **Study Participants**: Included boys (14-18 years) with testicular volume <4 ml and girls (13-18 years) at Tanner B1 stage.

3. **Tests Performed**: Hormonal analysis including basal LH, FSH, inhibin B, AMH, testosterone (boys), oestradiol (girls), triptorelin stimulation test, and 3-day HCG stimulation test (boys).

4. **Diagnostic Utility**: 4-hour post-triptorelin LH showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for IHH in both sexes; basal inhibin B had high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IHH.

5. **Key Findings**: Post-triptorelin 4-hour LH and inhibin B are reliable tests for distinguishing IHH from CDGP; basal LH, FSH, and AMH were poor discriminators.

6. **Follow-up Results**: Over a follow-up period of 1.5 years, 21 children were diagnosed with CDGP and 13 with IHH, with distinct hormonal profiles aiding diagnosis.

  

### Practical Take Home Message:

The post-triptorelin 4-hour LH test and basal inhibin B levels are effective in distinguishing IHH from CDGP, providing a reliable approach for timely and accurate diagnosis in clinical settings.
