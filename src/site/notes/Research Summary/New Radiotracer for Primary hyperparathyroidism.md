### Summary of the Article

**1. Title of the Article**  
*68Ga-Trivehexin PET/CT: A Promising Novel Tracer for Primary Hyperparathyroidism*

**2. First Two Authors Followed by et al.**  
Serkan Kuyumcu, Dilara Denizmen et al.

**3. One-Line Summary of the Article**  
This study evaluates the effectiveness of *68Ga-Trivehexin PET/CT* in detecting hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and compares its performance with 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy-SPECT/CT.

**4. Six Key Points from the Article**  
1. *68Ga-Trivehexin PET/CT* identified parathyroid lesions in 11 out of 13 PHPT patients, compared to 10 detected by the MIBI scan.  
2. In lesion-based analysis, *68Ga-Trivehexin PET/CT* detected 16 out of 17 parathyroid lesions (94.1%), while MIBI scan identified only 10 (58.8%).  
3. In three patients where *[18F]fluorocholine PET/CT* failed to detect any lesions, *68Ga-Trivehexin PET/CT* successfully identified lesions in two.  
4. The novel tracer demonstrated superior spatial resolution, leading to better lesion localization, particularly in small or ectopic adenomas.  
5. No adverse effects were observed with *68Ga-Trivehexin*, making it a potentially safe imaging alternative.  
6. The study highlights the need for further research to understand integrin receptor expression in parathyroid adenomas and validate *68Ga-Trivehexin* as a routine diagnostic tool.

**5. Practical Take-Home Message**  
*68Ga-Trivehexin PET/CT* is a promising imaging modality for detecting hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue, especially in cases where conventional MIBI scans are inconclusive. Its high sensitivity and specificity make it a valuable tool for improving surgical localization in PHPT.
