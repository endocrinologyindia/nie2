## **Summary of the Article**  

#### **1. Title of the article:**  
Performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the Characterization of Adrenal Masses in Noncancer Patients: A Prospective Study  

#### **2. First two Authors followed by et al:**  
Carole Guerin, François Pattou, et al.  

#### **3. One-line summary of the article:**  
This prospective multicenter study evaluates the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in differentiating benign and malignant adrenal masses in noncancer patients.  

#### **4. Six key points from the article:**  
1. **Study Design:** A prospective multicenter study including 87 patients with adrenal masses ≥40 mm or indeterminate nature based on CT findings.  
2. **Diagnostic Findings:** Malignant adrenal masses were larger, had higher unenhanced densities, lower relative washout, and higher 18F-FDG uptake compared to benign lesions.  
3. **Optimal Diagnostic Threshold:** A Tumor SUVmax to Liver SUVmax (Tmx:Lmx) ratio >1.5 had a sensitivity of 86.7% and specificity of 86.1% for malignancy.  
4. **Clinical Implications:** 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated high negative predictive value (96.9%) and can complement adrenal washout CT in characterization of adrenal masses.  
5. **Limitations:** Small sample size, multiple PET/CT camera models across centers, and lack of long-term follow-up for benign cases.  
6. **Conclusion:** 18F-FDG PET/CT should be recommended for evaluating large and/or indeterminate adrenal masses, improving malignancy detection.  

#### **5. Practical take-home message:**  
18F-FDG PET/CT serves as a valuable adjunct to adrenal washout CT in the workup of large or indeterminate adrenal masses, helping to refine surgical decision-making and reduce unnecessary resections.

# Additional Notes on the Topic 



## **Q. What is the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in adrenal lesion evaluation?**
18F-FDG PET/CT is highly valuable in distinguishing **benign** from **malignant** adrenal lesions by assessing metabolic activity. Malignant tumors typically exhibit **higher glucose metabolism**, which is reflected in increased FDG uptake.

## **Q. What is the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT?**
- **Sensitivity**: 93% to 100%
- **Specificity**: 80% to 94%
- **Overall accuracy**: Up to 96%

These high values indicate **strong reliability** in characterizing adrenal masses, particularly in **patients with known or suspected malignancies**.

## **Q. How is 18F-FDG PET interpreted for adrenal lesions?**
The scan is typically evaluated by comparing **FDG uptake in the adrenal mass** to that of the **liver**:

- **Benign lesions**: FDG uptake **≤ liver uptake**
- **Malignant lesions**: FDG uptake **> liver uptake**
  
A tumor **SUVmax to liver SUVmax ratio >1.5** has been shown to have high sensitivity (86.7%) and specificity (86.1%) for detecting malignancy.

## **Q. What are the advantages and limitations of 18F-FDG PET/CT?**
### **Advantages**
1. **High negative predictive value**, making it useful for ruling out malignancy.
2. **Whole-body evaluation**, helpful in detecting primary tumors or metastases.
3. **Complements CT and MRI**, especially for indeterminate adrenal masses.

### **Limitations**
1. **False positives**: Some **benign lesions** (pheochromocytomas, certain adenomas) can show increased FDG uptake.
2. **False negatives**: Some **malignant neuroendocrine tumors** may have only mild FDG uptake.

## **Q. What are the clinical applications of 18F-FDG PET/CT for adrenal lesions?**
1. **Cancer patients**: Detects adrenal **metastases** in patients with known malignancies.
2. **Non-cancer patients**: Useful in evaluating adrenal masses **even in those without malignancies**.
3. **Indeterminate adrenal lesions**: Helps characterize masses that **cannot be definitively diagnosed by CT or MRI**.
4. **Surgical decision-making**: Differentiating **lesions needing surgery** from those requiring **surveillance**.

## Q. What is the take from the research being from the KEM Mumbai ?

- The current expert opinion from KEM Mumbai is that there is often an overlap of SUVmax values of benign and malignant adrenal lesions. Hence, the interpretation of FDG-PET must not be done in isolation and must be done looking at other characteristics of the lesion.
- Additionally, pheochromocytomas may also show an uptake on FDG-PET making the interpretation difficult



## **Q. How do pheochromocytomas appear on 18F-FDG PET?**
Some Pheochromocytomas demonstrate **high avidity for 18F-FDG**

## **Q. What is the intensity of FDG uptake in pheochromocytomas?**
- Pheochromocytomas show **intense FDG uptake**, with **SUVmax values ranging from 2.3 to 29.3** (mean 9.7 ± 8.4).


## **Q. Why do pheochromocytomas have increased FDG uptake?**
The increased **glucose metabolism** in pheochromocytoma cells is due to:
1. **Upregulation of hexokinases** (HK-2 and HK-3)
2. **Activation of aerobic glycolysis** (Warburg effect)
3. **Increased expression of glucose transporters**

## **Q. How does FDG PET compare to other imaging modalities?**
- **FDG PET is superior to 123I-MIBG SPECT** in detecting pheochromocytoma, particularly in **metastatic disease**.
- **18F-FDOPA PET** may be **better than FDG PET** for detecting **well-differentiated** pheochromocytomas.

## **Q. Do genetic mutations influence FDG uptake in pheochromocytomas?**
- **SDHx-related pheochromocytomas** (especially **SDHB mutations**) show **higher FDG uptake** due to:
  - Compromised oxidative phosphorylation
  - Pseudohypoxic response
- **SDHB-positive tumors** tend to have **greater FDG avidity** than **SDHB-negative tumors**.

## **Conclusion**
18F-FDG PET/CT is an **effective and useful** tool in evaluating adrenal lesions. While it should be **interpreted alongside clinical data and other imaging** techniques, its **high sensitivity and specificity** make it **valuable** in addition in distinguishing between **benign and malignant adrenal masses**.
