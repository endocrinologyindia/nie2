### **Summary of the Article**

#### **1. Title of the Article**  
Dapagliflozin plus calorie restriction for remission of type 2 diabetes: multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial  

#### **2. First Two Authors Followed by et al.**  
Yuejun Liu, Ying Chen, et al.  

#### **3. One-line Summary of the Article**  
A combination of dapagliflozin and calorie restriction significantly increases the rate of type 2 diabetes remission compared to calorie restriction alone in overweight or obese patients.  

#### **4. Six Key Points from the Article**  

1. **Study Design & Participants** – A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in China with 328 overweight or obese patients (BMI >25) with type 2 diabetes of less than 6 years’ duration.  

2. **Intervention & Outcome** – Participants followed a calorie-restricted diet (500-750 kcal deficit per day) and received either dapagliflozin (10 mg/day) or a placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c <6.5% and fasting plasma glucose <126 mg/dL without antidiabetic medication for at least 2 months.  

3. **Primary Findings** – Diabetes remission was achieved in 44% of patients in the dapagliflozin group vs. 28% in the placebo group (Risk Ratio: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.17-2.09, p=0.002).  

4. **Weight & Metabolic Improvements** – The dapagliflozin group had greater weight loss (−5.0 kg vs. −3.2 kg, p<0.001), improved insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: −0.8, p<0.001), and better metabolic parameters including blood pressure, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol.  

5. **Safety & Adverse Events** – No significant differences in adverse event rates between the groups; urinary tract infections were slightly higher in the dapagliflozin group but no severe complications were reported.  

6. **Clinical Implications** – This study suggests a feasible pharmacological approach to achieving diabetes remission using a combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors and moderate calorie restriction, which may be more practical than very low-calorie diets or bariatric surgery.  

#### **5. Practical Take-Home Message**  
For overweight or obese patients with early type 2 diabetes, a regimen of dapagliflozin combined with a moderate calorie deficit significantly increases the likelihood of diabetes remission. This strategy provides a viable, non-invasive alternative to intensive calorie restriction or bariatric surgery.
