# *Ultrasound-Guided Glenohumeral Corticosteroid Injection for the Treatment of Adhesive Capsulitis of the Shoulder: The Role of Clinical Stage in Response to Treatment*
### Summary of the Article

1. **Title of the Article**:  
   *Ultrasound-Guided Glenohumeral Corticosteroid Injection for the Treatment of Adhesive Capsulitis of the Shoulder: The Role of Clinical Stage in Response to Treatment*

2. **First Two Authors Followed by et al**:  
   Brittany M. Ammerman, MD, and Elizabeth R. Dennis, MD, et al.

3. **One-Line Summary of the Article**:  
   Early-stage ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections significantly improve recovery outcomes in adhesive capsulitis by reducing pain and restoring range of motion.

4. **Six Key Points from the Article**:  
   1. Adhesive capsulitis is staged from 1 to 4, with Stages 1 and 2 characterized by synovial inflammation and early fibrosis.  
   2. Ultrasound-guided glenohumeral injection (USGI) with corticosteroids enhances recovery in Stages 1 and 2 by targeting synovial inflammation.  
   3. Recovery times were shorter for Stage 1 patients (2-6 weeks) compared to Stage 2 patients (7-10 weeks).  
   4. Stage 1 patients showed higher recovery rates in all motion planes, with 100% recovery in forward flexion and internal rotation.  
   5. Stage 2 patients had lower recovery rates and longer recovery times, with only 50-72% meeting recovery criteria across motion planes.  
   6. Timely diagnosis and intervention in Stage 1 are crucial to prevent progression to capsular fibrosis and prolonged recovery.  

5. **Practical Take-Home Message**:  
   Recognizing adhesive capsulitis early (Stages 1-2) and intervening with ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections can significantly expedite recovery and reduce long-term disability.
