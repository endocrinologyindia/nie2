Prasugrel, a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, is increasingly recognized for its role in managing atherothrombotic risk in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), a population with heightened platelet reactivity and cardiovascular morbidity[^1][^2]. This review synthesizes evidence relevant to endocrinologists managing diabetic patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

## **Key Evidence in Diabetic Populations**

  

### **1.** 

### **Superior Efficacy Over Clopidogrel**

- In the **TRITON-TIMI 38 trial**, prasugrel reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 30% in diabetics vs. 14% in non-diabetics, driven by a 40% reduction in myocardial infarction (MI)[^2].
    
- Insulin-treated diabetics derived even greater benefit, with a 37% reduction in MACE and 44% lower MI risk[^2].
    
- **PROMETHEUS observational data** confirmed prasugrel’s association with lower 90-day and 1-year mortality in diabetics post-PCI[^1].
    

  

### **2.** 

### **Bleeding Risk Balance**

- Unlike non-diabetics, prasugrel did not increase major bleeding in diabetics (2.5% vs. 2.6% with clopidogrel)[^2].
    
- Net clinical benefit (ischemia reduction without bleeding penalty) was greater in diabetics (26% risk reduction)[^2].
    

  

### **3.** 

### **Mechanistic Relevance**

- DM is linked to clopidogrel resistance due to upregulated P2Y12 pathways. Prasugrel’s irreversible, consistent platelet inhibition addresses this[^2].

## **Practical Considerations for Endocrinologists**

- **Indications**: Prioritize prasugrel for ACS patients with DM undergoing PCI, particularly those with insulin resistance or high thrombotic burden[^3].
    
- **Dosing**:
    
    - **Loading dose**: 60 mg
        
    - **Maintenance**: 10 mg daily (5 mg if <60 kg)[^2]
        
    
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in prior stroke/TIA or age ≥75 years unless high ischemic risk[^2]
    
- **Duration**: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin for 12 months post-PCI; consider longer duration in select high-risk cases[^3]

## **Guideline Recommendations**

- **ESC Guidelines** endorse prasugrel as preferred over ticagrelor for non-ST-elevation ACS patients undergoing PCI[^3].
    
- **ADA Consensus**: Highlights prasugrel’s role in reducing recurrent ischemic events in diabetics without excess bleeding[^2].

## **Conclusion**

  

Prasugrel offers tailored antiplatelet therapy for diabetic patients, mitigating thrombotic risk while maintaining a favorable safety profile. Endocrinologists should collaborate with cardiologists to optimize its use in high-risk ACS populations.
