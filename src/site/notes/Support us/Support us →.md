**Since its inception,** **_Notes in Endocrinology_** **and** **_Endocrinology India_** **have always been free initiatives. However, it costs us about Rs. 40,000 (approximately $500) per month to keep them running. We previously had to shut down several initiatives (like EndoAI) due to a lack of funds.**

**We want this initiative to grow and continue. You can support our efforts in the following ways:**
