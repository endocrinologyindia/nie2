### **What is the Body Roundness Index (BRI)?**  
The Body Roundness Index (BRI) is a newer way to measure body shape and estimate body fat, especially the fat around your organs (called visceral fat). It was introduced in 2013 as an improvement over the traditional Body Mass Index (BMI), which only considers height and weight.



### How is BRI Calculated?  
To calculate your BRI, you need two measurements:  
1. **Waist circumference** (measured around your belly)  
2. **Height**  

Both measurements should be in the same unit (e.g., centimeters). The formula uses these numbers to estimate your body fat and shape.

### What Do BRI Scores Mean?  
- **Less than 3**: Indicates a lean midsection.  
- **Around 5**: Considered normal and healthy.  
- **6.9 or higher**: Suggests a rounder body shape and is linked to higher health risks, including a 49% increased risk of death.

### Why is BRI Useful?  
- It provides a better estimate of body fat and visceral fat compared to BMI.  
- It helps identify obesity-related health risks more accurately.  
- It’s a simple, non-invasive tool that can be used in clinics or public health settings.

---

### Limitations of BRI  
- BRI is still a relatively new measure, so there’s less research on it compared to BMI.  
- It may not work as well for people with certain body types, potentially underestimating fat in some cases.  
- It should be used alongside other health assessments, not as the only measure of health.

### Practical Takeaway  
The Body Roundness Index (BRI) is a helpful tool to assess body shape and health risks, especially for visceral fat. Doctors should consider using BRI along with BMI to get a clearer picture of obesity-related risks. If your BRI is 6.9 or higher, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about ways to improve your health.
