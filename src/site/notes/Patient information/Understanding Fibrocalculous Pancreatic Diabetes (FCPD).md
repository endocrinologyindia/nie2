**What is FCPD?**  
FCPD is a type of diabetes linked to a condition called non-alcoholic calcific pancreatitis, which is more common in developing countries. It involves damage to the pancreas, leading to diabetes and other complications.

---

**Key Points About FCPD:**

1. **Prediabetic Form:**  
   Before FCPD develops, a condition called **tropical calcific pancreatitis (TCP)** often occurs. This is an early stage where the pancreas starts to show damage.

2. **Difference Between TCP and Alcoholic Pancreatitis:**  
   - TCP is caused by factors like malnutrition and is not related to alcohol.  
   - Alcoholic pancreatitis is caused by excessive alcohol consumption.  

3. **Who Discovered FCPD?**  
   The condition was first described by **Dr. Geeverghese**.

4. **Types of Malnutrition-Related Diabetes (MRDM):**  
   - Fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD)  
   - Protein-deficient diabetes mellitus  

5. **Typical Symptoms of FCPD (Triad):**  
   - **Abdominal pain** (starts in childhood)  
   - **Pancreatic stones** (develop in adolescence)  
   - **Diabetes** (appears in adulthood)  

6. **Where Are Pancreatic Stones Seen?**  
   On an X-ray, these stones are usually found near the **L1/L2 vertebrae** in the spine.

7. **Ketosis in FCPD:**  
   Unlike other types of diabetes, patients with FCPD **do not develop ketosis** (a condition where the body produces high levels of blood acids).

8. **Food Linked to FCPD:**  
   Eating **cassava** (a root vegetable) has been linked to FCPD, especially in areas where malnutrition is common.

9. **Cancer Risk:**  
   People with FCPD have a **higher risk of pancreatic cancer**.

10. **Complications:**  
    FCPD can lead to **microvascular complications** (like eye and kidney problems) and **pancreatic osteodystrophy** (weak bones due to malnutrition and diabetes).

---

**Diagnosis of FCPD:**  
To diagnose FCPD, doctors look for:  
- Diabetes in a patient from a tropical country.  
- No other cause of pancreatitis.  
- Additional signs like abnormal pancreas imaging, recurrent abdominal pain, or digestive issues (steatorrhea).  

Tests include:  
- **Imaging:** X-rays, ultrasounds, or CT scans to check for pancreatic stones or damage.  
- **Pancreatic Function Tests:** These measure how well the pancreas is working.  

---

**Treatment of FCPD:**  
1. **Diabetes Management:**  
   - Most patients need **insulin** to control blood sugar.  
   - Some may use oral medications, but certain drugs (like incretin-based therapies) are avoided.  

2. **Pain Management:**  
   - Painkillers (non-opioid or opioid) are used for abdominal pain.  
   - In severe cases, procedures like **ERCP** (to remove stones) or surgery may be needed.  

3. **Nutritional Support:**  
   - A diet rich in **proteins and carbohydrates** is recommended to combat malnutrition.  
   - **Fat-soluble vitamins** (A, D, E, K) are given to address deficiencies.  
   - **Pancreatic enzyme supplements** (like Creon) help with digestion.  

4. **Monitoring for Complications:**  
   - Regular check-ups are needed to detect and manage complications like pancreatic cancer or osteoporosis.

**Why No Ketosis in FCPD?**  
Patients with FCPD don’t develop ketosis because:  
- Their bodies don’t produce enough fatty acids, which are needed for ketosis.  
- They still have some insulin production, which prevents ketosis.  
- Certain fats in their bodies are resistant to breaking down.  

---

**Real-Life Case Example:**  
A 30-year-old man lost a lot of weight and was diagnosed with diabetes. He had a history of abdominal pain in his 20s but was never tested. A CT scan showed pancreatic stones, confirming FCPD. He was treated with insulin, enzyme supplements, and nutritional support, which helped him regain weight and control his blood sugar.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- FCPD is a rare but serious condition linked to malnutrition and pancreatic damage.  
- Early diagnosis and proper treatment (insulin, enzymes, and nutrition) can improve quality of life.  
- Regular monitoring is essential to prevent complications like pancreatic cancer.
