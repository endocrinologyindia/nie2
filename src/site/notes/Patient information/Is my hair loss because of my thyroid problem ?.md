### Understanding Hair Loss and Thyroid Issues

#### What is Telogen?
- **Telogen** is the resting phase of the hair growth cycle. During this phase, hair stops growing and eventually falls out.

#### What is Telogen Effluvium?
- **Telogen effluvium** is a common cause of hair loss, usually temporary.
- It happens when the body experiences stress, illness, or major changes, causing hair to enter the resting phase and stop growing temporarily.
- If this phase lasts too long, noticeable hair loss occurs. However, hair usually grows back once the underlying issue is resolved.
- Thyroid problems, like hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, can also cause this type of hair loss.

#### Does Hypothyroidism or Hyperthyroidism Cause Hair Loss?
- **Both** hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can lead to hair loss.

#### What Does Hair Loss Look Like in Thyroid Disorders?
- Hair loss is usually **diffuse**, meaning it happens all over the scalp rather than in specific patches.

#### Types of Hair Loss in Hypothyroidism
- A study found the following patterns of hair loss in people with hypothyroidism:
  - **Diffuse hair loss** (most common, 70%)
  - **Alopecia areata** (sudden patchy hair loss, 11%)
  - **Androgenetic alopecia** (pattern hair loss, 14%)
  - Other rare types like **cicatricial alopecia**, **alopecia totalis**, and **alopecia universalis** (complete hair loss).

#### Does Mild Hypothyroidism Cause Hair Loss?
- **No**, mild hypothyroidism (subclinical hypothyroidism) is unlikely to cause hair loss. This is a common misconception.

#### Does Hair Loss Worsen After Starting Thyroid Treatment?
- **Yes**, hair loss may temporarily worsen when starting treatment for hypothyroidism.
- This happens because the hair follicles become active again and shed old hair. New, healthy hair will grow back over time.

#### Does Radioactive Iodine Therapy Cause Hair Loss?
- **No**, radioactive iodine therapy (used for Graves' disease) does not cause hair loss.

#### Do Antithyroid Drugs Cause Hair Loss?
- **Yes**, some antithyroid drugs like **Carbimazole** and **PTU** can cause hair loss.

#### What is Alopecia Areata?
- **Alopecia areata** is a condition where hair falls out in round patches. It’s more common in children.
- It’s thought to be an autoimmune condition, and there may be a link with hypothyroidism, which is also often autoimmune.

#### Does Treating Hypothyroidism Help Alopecia Areata?
- Alopecia areata usually follows its own course, but treating hypothyroidism with **levothyroxine** may help improve hair loss caused by **telogen effluvium**.

#### How to Tell the Difference Between Alopecia Areata and Thyroid-Related Hair Loss?
- **Alopecia areata** causes patchy hair loss, while thyroid-related hair loss is more **diffuse** (all over the scalp).

#### Does Hypothyroidism Cause Hair Loss in Other Areas?
- **Yes**, hypothyroidism can cause hair loss in other areas, like the eyebrows and body hair.
- A classic sign of hypothyroidism is **madarosis**, which is the loss of eyelashes or eyebrows, though this is rare.

#### What is Madarosis?
- **Madarosis** is the loss of eyelashes (**ciliary madarosis**) or eyebrows (**superciliary madarosis**).

#### Do Hair Supplements Affect Thyroid Function?
- **Yes**, some hair supplements can affect thyroid function:
  1. **Iodine**: Some supplements contain iodine, which can cause thyroid problems.
  2. **Biotin**: This vitamin, often found in hair supplements, can interfere with thyroid function tests.

#### How Common is Biotin in Endocrine Tests?
- At least **50%** of endocrine tests use biotin in their testing process.

#### Can Biotin Cause False Test Results?
- **Yes**, biotin can cause:
  - **False low results** for hormones like TSH, FSH, and prolactin.
  - **False high results** for hormones like T3, T4, and steroid hormones.

#### Clinical Pearl:
- Biotin can cause false results that might lead to a wrong diagnosis of **Graves' disease** (a type of hyperthyroidism).

#### Where is High-Dose Biotin Used?
- **Dermatology**: For hair and nail health.
- **Neurology**: For conditions like **multiple sclerosis**.

#### How Much Biotin Causes Test Interference?
- Doses of **more than 5 mg/day** can interfere with lab tests.

#### How Long Should You Stop Biotin Before Testing?
- Stop taking biotin for at least **2-3 days** before testing. For people with kidney problems, a longer period may be needed.

#### How Can Labs Check for Biotin Interference?
- Labs can use **streptavidin beads** or other methods to detect biotin interference.

#### What Else Can Cause Test Interference Like Biotin?
- The presence of **streptavidin antibodies** can cause similar test interference.

#### Do Parathyroid Conditions Cause Hair Loss?
- **Yes**, parathyroid conditions can also lead to hair loss.

#### Does Central Hypothyroidism Cause Hair Loss?
- **Yes**, central hypothyroidism (a rare type of hypothyroidism) can cause hair loss, especially **androgenetic alopecia** in women.

#### Other Skin Issues Linked to Hypothyroidism:
- **Vitiligo** (loss of skin color in patches).
- **Urticaria** (hives or rashes).

### Key Takeaways:
- Hair loss can be caused by thyroid problems, stress, or illness.
- Treating the underlying thyroid issue often helps improve hair loss.
- Be cautious with hair supplements containing **iodine** or **biotin**, as they can affect thyroid function and lab tests.
- If you’re experiencing hair loss, consult a doctor to check for thyroid or other health issues.
