### **Diabetes Remission vs. Reversal: Why "Remission" is the Preferred Term**

The use of "diabetes remission" instead of "diabetes reversal" is a deliberate choice based on a nuanced understanding of type 2 diabetes and its management. Here’s why:



#### **Q. Why is "remission" used instead of "reversal" for type 2 diabetes?**
- **Remission** suggests a temporary state where diabetes is well-managed, but it can return.
- **Reversal** implies a permanent change, which can be misleading.
- Type 2 diabetes is a **chronic condition** that can relapse if triggering factors resurface.


#### **Q. Does diabetes remission mean a patient is cured?**
- **No, remission is not a cure**. 
- Patients achieving remission still require **ongoing monitoring and lifestyle adjustments**.
- Some metabolic and genetic predispositions **remain even when blood sugar normalizes**.

#### **Q. What is the medical consensus on this terminology?**
- Leading organizations like the **American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and Diabetes UK** agree that "remission" is the most appropriate term.
- The consensus provides **consistent language** for healthcare professionals and research.


#### **Q. What happens if people believe in "reversal" instead of "remission"?**
- It may **mislead patients** into thinking diabetes is permanently gone.
- This can lead to **neglect of follow-ups and lifestyle maintenance**, increasing the risk of relapse.


#### **Q. Does diabetes remission require ongoing care?**
- **Yes, even in remission, diabetes requires monitoring**.
- Blood glucose should be checked **regularly**.
- Healthy lifestyle habits must be **maintained** to prevent recurrence.



#### **Q. How does diabetes remission compare to remission in other diseases?**
- Similar to **oncology**, where "remission" is used when cancer is undetectable but may return.
- It reflects that **underlying risks still exist** despite normal clinical markers.



#### Who Can Achieve Remission?
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: People with type 2 diabetes, especially those who are younger, overweight, or have fatty liver or pancreas, are good candidates.
- **Other Types**: Some types of diabetes caused by medications, pregnancy, or other conditions can also go into remission.
- **Not Possible**: Type 1 diabetes and certain genetic forms of diabetes (like MODY) cannot achieve remission.

#### How is Remission Defined?
- **HbA1c**: Your average blood sugar level (HbA1c) should be less than 6.5% for at least 3 months.
- **No Medications**: You should not be taking any diabetes medications during this time.
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: You still need regular check-ups to make sure your diabetes stays under control.

#### How Can You Achieve Remission?
- **Weight Loss**: Losing weight is key. This can be done through:
  - Healthy eating and exercise.
  - Meal replacement programs.
  - Medications that help with weight loss.
  - Bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery).
- **Early Intensive Insulin Therapy**: In some cases, short-term insulin treatment can help improve your body’s ability to manage blood sugar.

#### What Are the Benefits of Remission?
- **Improved Health**: Better blood sugar control can reduce the risk of complications like heart disease, kidney problems, and nerve damage.
- **Quality of Life**: You may feel better and have more energy.
- **Cost Savings**: You might save money on medications and healthcare.

#### What Are the Challenges?
- **Maintenance**: Remission requires ongoing effort. You need to stick to a healthy lifestyle.
- **Relapse**: If you regain weight or stop following healthy habits, diabetes can return.
- **False Promises**: Be cautious of quick fixes or products that claim to cure diabetes. There’s no magic solution.

#### What Do Studies Say?
- **DiRECT Trial**: A study showed that 46% of people who followed a weight loss program achieved remission after 1 year, and 36% maintained it after 2 years.
- **Bariatric Surgery**: Weight loss surgery has helped many people achieve remission, with 76.6% staying medication-free for 2 years.
- **Early Insulin Therapy**: Short-term insulin treatment has helped some people achieve remission, especially if they had diabetes for a short time.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Remission is Possible**: With the right approach, many people with type 2 diabetes can achieve remission.
- **Lifestyle is Key**: Weight loss and healthy habits are crucial.
- **Ongoing Care**: Regular check-ups and monitoring are essential to maintain remission.

If you think you might be a candidate for diabetes remission, talk to your doctor about the best approach for you. Remember, remission is a journey, not a one-time event. Stay committed to your health!
