## How should I take the 21-day pill pack for PCOS?

- Take one pill daily for 21 consecutive days.
- After 21 days, take a 7-day break before starting the next pack.
- Start your new pack on the same day of the week as you started your previous pack.

## When is the best time to take the pill?

- Take the pill at the same time every day to maintain consistent hormone levels.
- Choose a time that's easy to remember, such as before bed.

## How does the pill help with PCOS?

- The pill helps regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen levels.
- It may improve acne, hirsutism (excess hair growth), and other PCOS symptoms.

## What if I miss a pill?

- If you miss one pill, take it as soon as you remember, even if it means taking two pills in one day.


## Will I have a period during the 7-day break?

- You will likely experience a withdrawal bleed during the 7-day break.
- This bleed may be lighter and more regular than your natural periods.

## How long does it take to see improvements in PCOS symptoms?

- Some women may notice improvements within 3-4 months.
- It may take up to 6 months to see the full benefits of the treatment.
