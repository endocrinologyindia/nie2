- **Other notes**
- Q. What is the definition of malignant pheochromocytoma? 
    - WHO definition- the presence of distant metastasis 
    - In other tumors breach of the capsule defines malignancy
    - Not so in pheochromocytoma 
- Q. Which patients are more likely to have metastatic disease? 
    - extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma
    - SDHB mutation
    - Size >4-5 cm

    - Patient resting before doing the test (no exercise) 
- Q. What is the role of chromogranin A in Pheochromocytoma / PPGL? 
    - It is raised in 80% of cases
    - However, it is not specific
    - It is a useful tumor marker for follow-up of patients with metastatic disease
    - PPI often increases CgA 
- Q. Acetaminophen interferes with which assays? 
    - Liquid chromatography assays 
    - Stop for 1 week 
- Q. Do SSRI /SNRI interfere ? 
    - Yes 
- Q. Enlist the medication list which interferes with testing. 
    - Acetaminophen
    - Sympathomimetics
    - Tricyclic antidepressants
    - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
    - Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
    - Levodopa
    - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
    - Some beta-blockers (especially non-selective)
    - Some alpha-blockers (i.e. phenoxybenzamine)
    - Marijuana and other illicit drugs
- Q. Which is the best first-line imaging?
    - Cross-section CT/ MRI is the best first-line test 
- Q. Are all tumors MIBG avid? 
    - No
    - Only 60% are MIBG avid
    - 40% are not 
- Q. What is the difference between Phenoxybenzamine vs prazosin? 
    - Phenoxybenzamine is non selective alpha blocker
    - Prazosin is a selective alpha1 blocker 
    - Also phenoxybenzamine is irreversible binding while prazosin is reversible binding 
- Q. What are the advantage and disadvantages of one over the other? 
    - Prazosin – can potentially be knocked off if there is a surge in catecholamine this can cause a problem in the case of an intraoperative period when a tumor is manipulated. This is not seen over phenoxybenzamine
    - Phenoxybenzamine produces more problems post-op because since there is irreversible binding → new receptors need to be generated post-op to prevent hypotension. This is not seen with prazosin 
- Q. What is the mechanism of action of tyrosine? 
    - It blocks tyrosine hydroxylase 
- Q. Is metyrosine beneficial? 
    - Studies have shown less CV complication in metyrosine + Pheoxybenzamine vs PBZ alone 
- Q. the regimen used in adults, is it the same as in children? 
    - Yes 
- Q. When is cortical sparing surgery done? 
    - Experience surgeons who can do that for patients with bilateral adrenal disease or susceptibility to bilateral disease
