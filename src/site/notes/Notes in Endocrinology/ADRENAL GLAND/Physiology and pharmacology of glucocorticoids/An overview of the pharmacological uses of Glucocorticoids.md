	- [[Basics about Steroids\|Basics about Steroids]]

- Q. What are glucocorticoids?
    - They are a class of corticosteroids, i.e., Steroid hormones that produce the Adrenal cortex 
    - They bind to glucocorticoid receptors


- Q. What is the use of glucocorticoids in endocrinology? 
    - Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome
    - Treatment of adrenal insufficiency
    - Treatment of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
    - Treatment of glucocorticoid remediable hypertension
    - Treatment of active Graves ophthalmopathy
    - Treatment of thyroid storm 


- **Pharmacokinetics**  


- Q. How do endogenous Glucocorticoids circulate in the blood? 
    - Majority of the glucocorticoids are in the bound state bound to Cortisol binding globulin (CBG) or albumin 
    - Free glucocorticoids may also be bound to RBCs 


- Q. How do synthetic glucocorticoids circulate in blood? 
    - They do not bind with CBG 
    - They are loosely bound to albumin 


- Q. Which synthetic glucocorticoid does bind to CBG?
    - Prednisolone


- Q. What is the half-life of endogenous Cortisol? 
    - 80 min 


- Q. What is the role of 11 beta HSD1? Where is it located? 
    - It converts cortisone to Cortisol 
    - It is found in most of the target tissues for glucocorticoid action 


- Q. What about 11 beta HSD2? 
    - It inactivates Cortisol
    - It converts Cortisol to cortisone
    - It is found in mineralocorticoid action tissue like
        - Kidney
        - Placenta
        - Colon
        - Salivary glands 


- Q. Which are the fluorinated glucocorticoids? 
    - Dexamethasone
    - Fludrocortisone
    - Triamcinolone 


- Q. Which are the other modifications to glucocorticoids? 
    - Methylated- Methylprednisolone
    - Methyoxazoline addition – deflazacort 


- Q. What is the effect of fluorination/methylation on Pharmacokinetics ? 
    - Reduces inactivation by 11 beta HSD2  


- Q. What about prednisone ? 
    - It is more effectively metabolized by 11 beta HSD2 than Cortisol
    - Hence it has a more negligible mineralocorticoid effect


- Q. Which drugs reduce the efficacy of Glucocorticoids by causing CYP34A enzyme induction? 
    - Rifampicin 
    - Anticonvulsants 
    - Efavarinez


- Q. Which drugs inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes, which cause toxicity due to glucocorticoids? 
    - Cyclosporine and tacrolimus
    - Ritonavir
    - Isoniazid
    - Antifungals- ketoconazole, itraconazole
    - Estrogen  


- Q. Which glucocorticoids are not affected by the CYP3A4 mechanism? 
    - Prednisolone 


- Q. What are the various bioassays for glucocorticoids? 
    - 1. lowering eosinophil count in humans
    - 2. stimulation of hepatic glycogen deposition
    - 3. inhibit inflammation after subcutaneous oil injection in rodents 


- Q. What is the bioassay for Mineralocorticoid activity? 
    - Ability to inhibit sodium excretion in adrenalectomized rats 


- Q. Give the equivalent potencies of various glucocorticoids? 
    - Prednisolone 5 mg is equal to
        - Hydrocortisone 20 mg
        - Methylprednisolone 4 mg 
        - Dexamethasone 0.75 mg 


- Q. What time does the oral preparation of glucocorticoids take for absorption? 
    - 30 min 
    - With good bioavailability 


- **THERAPEUTIC USE OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS  **


- Q. What are the principles to follow when using glucocorticoids therapeutically?
    - A clear benefit of the use should be identified
    - glucocorticoids must be used only when other therapies are not an option or have failed
    - A specific therapeutic objective, duration or treatment, and objective criteria for response must be identified before starting treatment 
    -  Consider terminating if the therapeutic objective and response is not achieved
    - Steroid sparing regimens must be constantly considered in a long run
    - Non-systemic steroids are always preferred
    - Whenever given, care must be taken to provide glucocorticoid in the lowest possible dose in the most physiological way in which it is possible 


- Q. What is the mechanism of anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids? 
    - They act by trans-repression of Nuclear factor Kappa B (NF- kB)
    - NF-kB is a mediator of inflammatory action of TNF alpha 


- Q. Do inhaled, and topical steroids also cause hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression ? 
    - Yes 


- Q. Which inhaled steroid is notorious for HPA axis suppression? 
    - Fluticasone 


- Q. Does the site of local application affect HPA axis suppression  ? 
    - Yes
    - In sequence of likelihood of causing suppression 
        - intertriginous areas > forehead > scalp > face > forearm


- Q. Which vehicles used to increase systemic absorption ? 
    - Urea
    - Salicylate
    - Dimethylsulphoxide 


- Q. Which other factors affect systemic absorption ? 
    - presence of occlusive dressing
    - breach of the skin or tissue due to inflammation 
    - Age of the patient- more absorption at extremes of age


- Q. What are the lowest doses of glucocorticoids that can affect linear growth in children ? 
    - Doses as low as 
        - 0.075 mg/kg of prednisolone
        - 0.3 mg/kg of hydrocortisone 


- Q. Is alternate-day therapy successful in preventing HPA axis suppression ? 
    - No 


- Q. Which patients are more likely to have HPA axis suppression with glucocorticoids ? 
    - Prednisolone > 20 mg for >3 weeks
    - Prednisolone >5mg at night-time > 2 weeks
    - Patient having clinical features of iatrogenic Cushing's 


- Q. Which clinical features are more common in iatrogenic Cushing compared to endogenous Cushing's? 
    - Benign Raised ICT
    - Osteonecrosis of femoral head 
    - Posterior subcapsular cataract
    - Glaucoma
    - Panniculitis
    - Pancreatitis 
    - Spinal epidural lipomatosis

- Q. What is Glucocorticoid-Induced Leucine Zipper (GILZ)?

	-   Glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory actions. 
	-   However, they have significant long-term side effects.
	-   Researchers have now identified a new gene called glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ or tsc22d3) induced by Glucocorticoids.
	-   Activation of this gene leads to activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways that are the core process by which glucocorticoids induce their anti-inflammatory action.
	-   Identification of this gene could pave the way to the development of new drugs that could activate this gene without causing long term side effects. ^[Bereshchenko O, Migliorati G, Bruscoli S, Riccardi C. Glucocorticoid-Induced Leucine Zipper: A Novel Anti-inflammatory Molecule. Front Pharmacol. 2019 Mar 27;10:308. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00308. PMID: 30971930; PMCID: PMC6445858]
