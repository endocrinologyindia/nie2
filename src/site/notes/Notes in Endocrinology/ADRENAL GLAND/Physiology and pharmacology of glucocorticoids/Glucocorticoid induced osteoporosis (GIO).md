- Q. Summarize the effect of Glucocorticoids on bones ?
    - Calcium
        - Reduce calcium resorption from kidney
        - Reduce calcium absorption from intestine
    - Bone cells
        - Enhance osteoblast apoptosis
        - Reduce OPG  increase osteoclasts activity
    - Other hormones
        - Suppress Estrogen/testosterone  increase bone resorption
        - Suppresses GH-IGF1 axis → reduces bone formation


- Q.  What is the effect of Glucocorticoids on bone turnover  ?
    - Early – increased bone resorption
    - Later – mainly affects bone formation


- Q. Is secondary hyperparathyroidism a part of the pathogenesis of Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIO) ?
    - No
    - Recent data and literature suggest that PTH is not part of GIO


- Q. What is the difference between Thyroxin and Glucocorticoids – both of which cause bone loss ?
    - Thyroxine  bone loss → but also produces secondary hyperparathyroidism → increase bone formation
    - Glucocorticoids inhibits bone loss as well as bone formation → there is no secondary hyperparathyroidism


- #Clinicalpearl
    - As time passes- suppression of bone formation is the predominant effect in GIO


- Q. What type of fracture are particularly common with GIO ?
    - Vertebral fractures


- Q. What does Osteoprotegrein (OPG) do ?
    - OPG inhibits osteoclast formation and differentiation


- Q. What is the effect of Glucocorticoids on OPG ?
    - It reduces OPG  hence enhancing osteoclasts differentiation


- Q.  On which bone cells are Glucocorticoids receptors present ?
    - They are present on osteoblast  and they enhance osteoblasts apoptosis
    - They are not present on osteoclast-→ hence via OPG inhibition- they actually increase osteoclast activity early on


- Q. Summarize the effect of Glucocorticoids on bone cells ?
    - Glucocorticoids  inhibit osteoblast directly → reduce bone formation
    - Glucocorticoids → reduce OPG, increase RANKL activate osteoclast → increase bone resorption
    - Hence net increase resorption without increase bone formation


- Q. What is the mechanism of osteonecrosis secondary to Glucocorticoids ?
    - Apoptosis of osteoblasts causes osteonecrosis


- Q. What is the effect of Glucocorticoids on calcium metabolism ?
    - Increases urinary calcium excretion
    - Reduces calcium absorption from intestine
    - Basically action opposite to vitamin  D


- Q. Is there any dose of Glucocorticoids which is safe in terms of bones ?
    - Probably not
    - Studies have shown at doses as low as 2.5 mg/day of prednisolone have an effect on bone


- Q. Is alternate-day regimen protective of bone ?
    - No


- Q. Is physiological Glucocorticoids in adrenal insufficiency also associated with bone loss ?
    - Yes
    - Even the physiological replacement in AI produces bone loss


- Q. Do inhaled steroids also produce bone loss  ?
    - Studies have not consistently shown that they also impact the bone


- **CLINICAL FEATURES  **


- Q. What is the most common clinical presentation of GIO ?
    - They most often present with Asymptomatic vertebral fracture – often within 3-6 months of therapy


- Q. Do patients having Glucocorticoids have increased fracture risk beyond the same T score ?
    - Yes
    - For the same T score- patient taking Glucocorticoids have an increased risk of fractures


- Q. Why is vertebral fracture more common in GIO ?
    - Vertebral fracture are more common in patients on Glucocorticoids
    - This is because Glucocorticoids have more effect on trabecular bone and vertebra have more trabecular bone


- **Evaluation **


- Q. Which patient taking Glucocorticoids to require assessment ?
    - > Any patient taking Glucocorticoids of any dose for duration >3 months or anticipated duration >3 months require assessment


- Q. Which patients on Glucocorticoids require BMD assessment at baseline ?
    - All patients receiving Glucocorticoids or about to receive Glucocorticoids with duration/anticipated duration >3 months for any dose of Glucocorticoids require a DEXA for BMD


- Q. How much vitamin D is given to a patient with normal vitamin D and taking Glucocorticoids ?
    - 800 IU/day


- Q. Why is vertebral imaging important for patient on Glucocorticoids ?
    - Vertebral fracture are common
    - They are often asymptomatic
    - They are markers of risk of other fractures
    - It is also an indication for pharmacological therapy


- Q. Which patients require vertebral imaging  ?
    - If the patient already indicates Pharmacological therapy – then no need for vertebral imaging
    - However, if the patient per se does not have indication for pharmacological therapy (say T score of -1 to -2.5) – then a vertebral imaging will help establish the need for therapy


- Q. How is vertebral fracture diagnosed ?
    - Xray
    - Vertebral fracture assessment tool – present on DEXA machines – better because no separate X-ray appointment needed


- **PREVENTION AND TREATMENT **


- Q. Give a outline for management of GIO ?
    - STEP1 – BASELINE ASSESSMENT
        - 1.	Note the dose and duration of Glucocorticoids intake
        - 2.	Baseline DEXA scan for BMD
        - 3.	Xray of LS spine AP /Lateral or DEXA vertebral fracture assessment for :
            - a.	Not required for those already indicating Glucocorticoids use. Needed for the following :
                - i.	T score -1.0 to -2.5
                - ii.	Not having a history of fragility fracture
                - 4.	FRAX risk score calculation

            - e.	Estrogen and FSH/LH in females
    - STEP 2- General advice
        - 1.	Avoid falls
        - 2.	Correct vitamin D deficiency If present
        - a.	Vitamin D -800 IU/day of vitamin D is normal
        - 3.	Calcium – 1200 mg/day
        - 4.	Avoid smoking
        - 5.	Alcohol restriction
        - 6.	Weight-bearing exercise as tolerated
    - STEP 3- Hormone replacement
        - 1.	Testosterone / estrogen replacement in male/females if evidence of hypogonadism and no contraindications
    - STEP 4- Preventive/treatment indication for GIO
    - STEP 4.1-  Postmenopausal women / men >50 years of age
    - Step 4.1.1 Categorize risk- based on FRAX
        - 1.	 High risk – FRAX >20%
        - 2.	Moderate risk – FRAX- 10-20%
        - 3.	Low Risk- FRAX <10%
    - Step 4.1.2 – Medications
        - 1.	High risk
        - a.	Consider Teriparatide if :
            - i.	If dose of Glucocorticoids>5 mg or prednisolone for <1 month
            - ii.	Any dose of Glucocorticoids but duration >1 month
        - b.	In other cases Alendronate/ Zolendronate can be given
        - 2.	Moderate and low risk
        - a.	Bisphosphonate therapy if the anticipated duration of Glucocorticoids is >3 months in dose >7.5 mg equivalent of prednisolone
    - Step 4.1.3- Follow up
        - 1.	Annual DEXA scan to be done
        - 2.	If DEXA shows no decline in BMD- Then repeat every 1-2 years
        - 3.	If Glucocorticoids is stopped – consider stopping the medication is no other cause for osteoporosis exists
    - Step 4.2- Men age <50 years and Premenopausal women not having fertility potential
        - 1.	Patients not having fragility fracture- no indication
        - 2.	Patients having fragility fracture
        - a.	Glucorticoid duration 1-3 months- consider therapy if dose of Glucocorticoids> 5 mg equivalent of prednisolone
        - b.	Glucocorticoids duration >3 months- consider therapy irrespective of the dose
    - Step 4.3- Premenopausal women with fertility potential
        - 1.	Patients not having fragility fracture- no indication
        - 2.	Patients having fragility fracture
        - a.	Glucorticoid duration 1-3 months- No indication
        - b.	Glucocorticoids duration >3 months- consider therapy only for dose of prednisolone >7.5 mg . Avoid Zolendonate.


- Q. What dose of calcium and vitamin D are recommended for patient on Glucocorticoids ?
    - Calcium – 1200mg/day
    - Vitamin D- 800 IU/day


- Q. Should FRAX be calculated in all patients with Glucocorticoids ?
    - No
    - If the patient is already a candidate for Pharmacological therapy based on BMD and/or history of previous vertebral fracture than FRAX is not required
    - However, if the patient is not  a candidate for pharmacological therapy then FRAX is indicated


- Q. what FRAX score suggests a high risk of fracture ?
    - More than 20% for any fracture
    - More than 3% for hip fracture


- Q. Is FRAX and BMD enough ?
    - No
    - FRAX and BMD will not diagnose all patients with Glucocorticoids are risk of treatment
    - Remember – the patients on Glucocorticoids are at risk of fracture beyond that suggested by BMD
    - Also FRAX underestimates the risk of vertebral fracture which is common in patients taking Glucocorticoids
    - Hence FRAX and BMD both will underestimate the risk


- Q. Is Glucocorticoids a component of FRAX risk score calculation ?
    - Yes


- Q. According to ACR (American College of Rheumatology) guidelines, which are 3 groups for GIO ?
    - Three groups
        - Post menopausal / men >50 years
        - Men <50 years / premenopausal women – no fertility potential
        - Premenopausal women with fertility potential


- **Choice of therapy **


- Q. What is a choice of therapy by uptodate for men > 50 and postmenopausal women ?
    - Oral bisphosphonate is first choice
    - Zoledronate given if oral not tolerated
    - Teriparatide for
        - T score <-3.5
        - T score <-2.5 + fragility fracture


- Q. What about premenopausal women ?
    - Oral bisphosphonates – preferred
    - Zoledronate- avoided
    - Teriparatide- can be used if epiphysis have fused


- Q. Which is the probably the best drug to use in the treatment of GIO ?
    - Teriparatide
    - This is because GIO is a low turnover disease with reduced bone formation
    - Hence teriparatide is very useful in this disorder


- Q. Which is better for GIO- teriparatide or bisphosphonate ?
    - Study done by Saag et al showed better response with teriparatide compared to Bisphosphonate in terms of improvement in BMD at 18 and 36 months
    - Also in terms of vertebral fractures were less in teriparatide arm


- Q. Is hormone replacement advised ?
    - It patient is hypogonadal as a result of the Glucocorticoids and there are no contraindications, hormone replacement is advised


- Q. What happens after discontinuation of Glucocorticoids ?
    - There is improvement in BMD


- Q. What are the guidelines for monitoring a patient with GIO on treatment ?
    - BMD at baseline and one year after starting therapy
    - If BMD has improved or stable- less frequent monitoring may be required
    - If Glucocorticoids are discontinued and BMD is stable- monitoring every five years may be enough


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Glucocorticoids are the most common etiology of secondary drug-induced osteoporosis


- Q. What are the guidelines for BMD monitoring in patients on Glucocorticoids ?
    - All patients on Glucocorticoids – before starting Glucocorticoids and while taking Glucocorticoids must undergo BMD
    - This must be repeated every six months


- Q. Is COPD itself associated with osteoporosis?
    - Yes
    - 30-60% of patient with COPD have osteoporosis
