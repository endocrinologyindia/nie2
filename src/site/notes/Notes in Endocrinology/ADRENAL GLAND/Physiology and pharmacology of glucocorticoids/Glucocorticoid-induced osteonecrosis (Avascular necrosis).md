- Q. What are the other terms used for Osteonecrosis?
    - aseptic necrosis
    - avascular necrosis (AVN)
    - atraumatic necrosis
    - ischemic necrosis


- Q. What is osteonecrosis?
    - Any process that interferes with the vascular supply of the bones produces ischemia and eventual necrosis. This is osteonecrosis. 


- Q. Enlist the causes of osteonecrosis.
    - Fracture of femur neck (traumatic)
    - Non-traumatic
        - Corticosteroids
        - SLE
        - Alcoholic
        - Pancreatitis
        - Sickle cell
        - HIV
        - Radiation
        - Chronic kidney disease 
        - Transplantation
        - Decompression illness
        - APLA syndrome 


- Q. What are the possible etiologies of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis?
    - Changes in venous endothelial cells → blocking of veins
    - Alteration of fat à production of microemboli → ischemic necrosis
    - Increase of bone marrow fat → blocking of venous circulation


- Q. Which is more important for the causation of osteonecrosis- dose or duration of glucocorticoid?
    - Duration- typically osteonecrosis occurs with a long duration of therapy
    - It can occur with any dose of medication,  even low doses used in physiological replacement can cause osteonecrosis


- Q. Which medication used in the treatment of osteoporosis is associated with osteonecrosis?
    - Bisphosphonate especially when used in the context of malignancy like multiple myeloma etc
    - It is generally associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw
    - Similar features may also be seen with [[Denosumab\|Denosumab]]


- **CLINICAL FEATURES  **


- Q. Which is the most common site of osteonecrosis?
    - Anterolateral aspect of the femoral head


- Q. What is the most common clinical manifestation?
    - Pain is the most common manifestation


- Q. Can it be asymptomatic?
    - Yes


- Q. What kind of X-rays are ordered to make the diagnosis?
    - AP, Lateral, and frog-leg position for pelvis and hip


- Q. What is the classical sign seen in Xray?
    - "Crescent sign"
    - However, it occurs late only when joint collapse occurs
    - ![Crescent sign - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Crescent_sign_annotated.jpg)


- Q. What is the role of a bone scan in this condition?
    - Area of increased uptake in the junction of dead and alive tissue with a central cold area is seen on a bone scan
    - This is a classical "doughnut sign"
    - ![Bone scan with 99m Tc-MDP in a patient suspected of having avascular... |  Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Napoleone-Prandini/publication/8216253/figure/fig4/AS:277827510390788@1443250648356/Bone-scan-with-99m-Tc-MDP-in-a-patient-suspected-of-having-avascular-necrosis-of-the.png)


- Q. What is the best imaging modality for osteonecrosis?
    - MRI – 100% sensitivity
    - High-intensity lines in MRI are typical
    - It is the gold standard in the diagnosis of this lesion


- Q. What is the pathological classification system for the disease?
    - Type I- prenecrotic
    - Type II- medullary space filled with necrotic tissue
    - Type III- marrow necrosis
    - Type IV- complete necrosis


- Q. What are the clinical stages of this lesion?
    - Stage 0 - diagnostic studies normal and diagnosis by histology only
    - Stage 1 - Plain radiographs and CT normal, MRI positive, and biopsy positive, with the extent of involvement A, B or C (less than 15 percent, 15 to 30 percent, and greater than 30 percent, respectively)
    - Stage 2- Radiographs positive but no collapse (no crescent sign), with the extent of involvement A, B, or C
    - Stage 3 - Early flattening of the dome and/or crescent sign on plain radiography or by CT or tomograms, with the extent of involvement A, B, or C and further characterization by the amount of depression (in millimeters) 
    - Stage 4 Flattening of the femoral head with joint space narrowing on plain radiography, as well as other signs of osteoarthritis


- **Treatment **


- Q. What are the treatment options?
    - Non-operative
    - Joint preserving surgery
    - Joint replacement


- Q. Is a non-operative strategy effective?
    - Non-operative interventions include medications, non-weight bearing, and rest
    - They are effective only in 20% of cases


- Q. Can bisphosphonate be used in the treatment of osteonecrosis?
    - Bisphosphonate in the treatment of osteonecrosis has shown mixed results


- Q. Which are other pharmacological agents used in the treatment of osteonecrosis?
    - Iloprost
    - Anticoagulants
    - Statins


- Q. Which are the various joint preserving procedures?
    - Fibular grafting
    - Decompression
    - Osteotomy


- #Real-life-cases
    - This is the MRI of a patient with Avascular necrosis of the femoral head
    - The patient had Exogenous Cushing's syndrome due to treatment from a local quack
    - He came in a Septic shock and was diagnosed to have tertiary adrenal insufficiency

-   [[December 9th, 2022\|December 9th, 2022]]
-   Q. Is there a role of [[Teriperatide\|Teriperatide]] in [[Avascular necrosis\|Avascular necrosis]]?
    -   Yes
    -   A study compared teriparatide to [[alendronate\|alendronate]] and found it to be more efficacious for preventing collapse compared to alendronate
    -   The mean duration of therapy was 18 months ^[Arai R, Takahashi D, Inoue M, Irie T, Asano T, Konno T, Terkawi MA, Onodera T, Kondo E, Iwasaki N. Efficacy of teriparatide in the treatment of nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: a retrospective comparative study with alendronate. BMC musculoskeletal disorders. 2017 Dec;18(1):1-6.]
-   Q. What does [[Teriperatide\|Teriperatide]] prevent in these cases ?
    -   They prevent the collapse of the femoral head
-   Q. How common is the collapse of the femoral head?
    -   It occurs in 75-80% of cases within 3-4 years
    -   It produces severe pain
    -   Most cases would need a total hip replacement in case of complete collapse
