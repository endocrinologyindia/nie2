- Q. Which Glucocorticoids side effects are irreversible?
    - Atherosclerotic risk
    - Bone loss 
    - Cataract


- Q. What are skin changes due to glucocorticoids?
    - Strain
    - Purpura
    - Acne
    - Hirsutism
    - Hypertrichosis
    - Alopecia
    - Non-melanotic skin cancers


- Q. What is the relation between Glucocorticoids use and skin cancer?
    - Increased risk of non-melanotic skin cancers like Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma has been reported with prolonged glucocorticoid use 


- Q. is the weight gain and Cushingoid effect dependent on the dose of glucocorticoids?
    - Yes
    - Weight gain and Cushingoid effect is generally seen with doses >7.5 mg and less common in doses <5 mg


- Q. How soon after starting treatment does the Cushingoid appearance start?
    - 2  months after starting treatment


- Q. Do patients with Glucocorticoids have increased appetite?
    - Yes
    - This is a common side effect


- **Eye involvement **


- Q. What are the features of cataracts seen with Glucocorticoids?
    - Posterior subcapsular in location
    - More in children than adults
    - Slowly developing
    - Bilateral


- Q. What does produces a cataract?
    - Any dose can produce
    - However, in general, prednisolone >10 mg for >1 year - they have more risk


- Q. What are the clinical features of these cataracts?
    - Glare
    - Difficulty in seeing in bright light
    - Diminution of vision


- Q. How is the diagnosis of the Posterior subcapsular cataract made?
    - By examination and looking for red reflex
    - Visual acuity testing
    - In some cases, ocular ultrasound look at the posterior segment of the eye


- Q. Do all Glucocorticoid patients develop glaucoma?
    - No
    - There is increase Intraocular pressure but no all develop glaucoma
    - Those who are predisposed are more likely to develop glaucoma
    - Steroid eye drops also increase the risk of glaucoma


- Q. Which is the other common ophthalmic complication pertaining to appearance?
    - Exophthalmos


- Q. Name another serious ophthalmic complication of iatrogenic Cushing’s?
    - Central serous chorioretinopathy


- **CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE **


- Q. Are Glucocorticoids associated with increased risk of Coronary artrey disease?
    - Yes


- Q. Is this dose-dependent?
    - Yes
    - Dose of prednisolone >7.5 mg /day – more risk


- Q. What about heart failure?
    - Risk of heart failure also increased


- Q. What type of arrhythmia risk is increased with glucocorticoid use?
    - Increased risk of Atrial fibrillation and flutter


- **Gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) **


- Q. Enlist the effects of Glucocorticoids on the GI tract?
    - Increased risk of
        - Gastritis
        - Peptic ulcer
        - GI bleeding
        - Pancreatitis
        - Steatohepatitis
        - Visceral perforation


- Q. Should prophylaxis for GI  bleeding be prescribed to the patient on Glucocorticoids?
    - Glucocorticoids alone – not required
    - Glucocorticoids + NSAID- advised


- Q. Do Glucocorticoids cause pancreatitis?
    - It is uncertain
    - It is believed that Glucocorticoids may not be the cause, and the underlying disease may be the cause


- Q. When does pancreatitis develop after starting Glucocorticoids?
    - Mainly after 4-14 days of starting Glucocorticoids
    - Risk reduces after 2 weeks


- *RENAL INVOLVEMENT**


- Q. Do Glucocorticoids cause fluid retention?
    - Yes
    - But it is a problem only in patients with renal or CV disease
    - This is because normal patients have an aldosterone escape mechanism that prevents fluid retention


- Q. Does it produce hypokalemia ?
    - Yes, often acutely
    - But significant chronic hypokalemia is generally not seen


- **Musculoskeletal **


- Q. Does it affect stature in children?
    - Yes
    - Even inhaled steroids affect stature


- Q. What are the lowest doses of glucocorticoids that can affect linear growth in children?
    - Doses as low as
        - 0.075 mg/kg of prednisolone
        - 0.3 mg/kg of hydrocortisone


- Q. What is the role of Glucocorticoids in causing Critical illness-associated myopathy?
    - It increases the risk of critical illness myopathy in critically ill patient, especially when used with neuromuscular blocking agents


- **CNS INVOLVEMENT **


- Q. What is Akathisia?
    - Motor restlessness
    - This is common in Glucocorticoids patients


- Q. What is the effect of Glucocorticoids on Mood?
    - It is biphasic
    - Initially, there is euphoria and even mania
    - Chronic use produces depression


- Q. Does it produce psychosis?
    - Yes
    - Especially with prednisolone dose >20 mg or more
    - More in patients with low albumin
    - Problem in Lupus because CNS lupus also produces similar psychosis


- Q. Does it affect memory?
    - Yes
    - Especially in older people
    - Some develop steroid-induced dementia


- Q. What about suicide?
    - There is increased suicidal tendencies for patients on Glucocorticoids


- Q. Can it produced raised ICT?
    - Yes
    - Often self-limiting


- **Glucose metabolism **


- Separate notes on the topic - COMING SOON


- Q. What is the relative risk of developing new-onset diabetes after Glucocorticoid use?
    - It is dose-dependent
    - Relative risk of 1.8 with 10mg dose increasing to 10.8 with 30 mg dose


- **INFECTION**


- Q. What is the effect of Glucocorticoids on WBC count?
    - It increases the WBC count
    - Mainly by it increasing the neutrophils
    - There is a shift of neutrophils from endothelium to the circulation


- Q. Which patients on Glucocorticoids can take live vaccines?
    - The following group can take live vaccines
        - Glucocorticoids dose <20 mg for <2 weeks
        - On physiological Glucocorticoids replacement
        - Nonsystemic administration of Glucocorticoids


- **OTHER SIDE EFFECTS**


- Q. What are the effects of Glucocorticoids on the Reproductive tract?
    - Menstrual irregularity
    - Reduced libido
    - Reduced fertility


- Q. Does the use of Glucocorticoids produce fetal adrenal insufficiency?
    - No


- Q. Does it increase the risk of teratogenicity?
    - Some suggest there is an increased risk of cleft palate
