- Q. Which patients develop Exogenous Cushing syndrome?
    - Patients taking Supraphysiological doses of Steroids for >3 weeks develop exogenous Cushing


- Q. Apart from glucocorticoids which drugs can lead to Cushing's?
    - Megestrol- a progesterone
    - Medroxyprogesterone
    - Fludrocortisone


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Cosmetic skin whiteners' may have glucocorticoids


- Q. How is the diagnosis of Exogenous Cushing syndrome made?
    - Low cortisol in the presence of Cushingoid symptoms


- Q. What is the value of cortisol in exogenous Cushing's?
    - 8 am cortisol < 3.6 ug/dl


- Q. In which cases of exogenous Cushing can the 8:00 am cortisol be normal or high?
    - Use of hydrocortisone- assay interference
    - Use of ACTH
    - Recovering from previous use of exogenous steroids
    - Use of prednisone / prednisolone


- Q. What are the causes of Normal or low 8:00 am cortisol despite endogenous Cushing's?
    - Causes of normal or low baseline cortisol with endogenous Cushing syndrome
        - Normocortisolemic Cushing's – Cortisol hyper-reactive syndrome
        - Pituitary apoplexy
        - bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) with GIP responsive receptors
        - Inactive phase of cyclical Cushing's
        - Ketoconazole therapy inpatient with Cushing syndrome 


- Q. What will happen to ACTH in exogenous Cushing's?
    - It will also be low


- Q. Due to the use of exogenous glucocorticoids, what is the level at which suppression occurs?
    - Suppression is mainly seen at the CRH level (Hypothalamus)
    - Eventually, because of the lack of stimulation, the adrenal gland also undergo atrophy


- Q. Why do patients on chronic Glucoritocid therapy fail ACTH stimulation even though the defect is at CRH level and at the level of adrenal cortex?
    - Because of adrenal atrophy


- Q. What are Factitious Cushing's and occult Cushing's?
    - Factitious- patient secretly taking glucocorticoid without the knowledge of the physician
    - Occult Cushing - a patient is taking Glucocorticoids without his/her knowledge


- Q. Which agent used in AIDS cachexia is known to cause Cushing syndrome?
    - Megesterol acetate (ENDACE, UNISTROL)
    - Also medroxyprogesterone


- Q. What are the differences in clinical presentation between Exogenous and Endogenous Cushing's?

- Q. Which clinical features are more common in Exogenous Cushing compared to endogenous Cushing's? 
    - Benign Raised ICT
    - Osteonecrosis of femoral head 
    - Posterior subcapsular cataract
    - Glaucoma
    - Panniculitis
    - Pancreatitis 
    - Spinal epidural lipomatosis 


- Q. Which clinical features as less common in exogenous Cushing's?
    - Hypertension
    - Hypokalemia
    - Hirsustism and virilization


- Q. What is the dreaded ocular complication with exogenous steroids?
    - Glaucoma


- Q. How is a diagnosis of Exogenous Cushing syndrome established?
    - Presence of low morning serum cortisol  and ACTH in the presence of Cushingoid symptoms
    - Low DHEAS is also a practical test for looking at the health of the HPA axis in such patients. It is beneficial for the assessment of the recovery of the HPA axis 


- Q. Do exogenous Steroids interfere with endogenous assays?
    - Yes
    - Most do
    - The exception is dexamethasone which does not interfere with the assay
    - Prednisolone is more likely to interfere 
    - Glucocorticoid in question can directly be assayed but only in specialized labs


- Q. What happens to ACTH stimulation test in Exogenous Cushing syndrome?
    - There is atrophy of the adrenal cortex
    - Hence there is less plasma cortisol response to ACTH


- Q.  What is Occult Cushing syndrome?
    - Patient receives glucocorticoids without their knowledge leading to clinical features of Cushing syndrome 


- Q. Which mode of glucocorticoid therapy does not cause Cushing syndrome?
    - There is no mode of therapy that does not cause Cushing
    - All modes of glucocorticoids may cause Cushing syndrome
    - However, it depends on the dose, duration, and many other factors 


- Q.  Can hydrocortisone also cause Cushing's?
    - Yes, If given in supraphysiological doses for a long time


- Q. Which clinical features appear within hours of glucocorticoid administration?
    - Insomnia
    - Increased appetite and psychological manifestations


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Cushing syndrome has been described with Intra-articular, Inhaled, and Topical preparations also !!


- Q. Which drugs used along with steroid increases the risk of Cushing's?
    - Itraconazole and ritonavir
    - They inhibit cytochrome p450 hence increasing the half-life of most steroids


- Q. What is "steroid withdrawal syndrome"?
    - Symptoms occurring because of steroids withdrawal even if the HPA axis is intact


- #Clinicalpearl
    - The dose and duration of steroids that can cause HPA axis suppression varies from individual to individual


- Q. What is the typical duration of use of steroids that is known to cause HPA axis suppression?
    - It is unknown
    - Most people believe it is three weeks
    - Some people believe that high doses can cause HPA axis suppression within five days
    - Physiological doses can cause HPA axis suppression after one month
    - HPA axis suppression may not in turn to adrenal insufficiency in all cases
    - Patients receiving frequent short courses of steroids also have significant HPA axis suppression


- Q. Which patients are more likely to have HPA axis suppression with glucocorticoids? 
    - Prednisolone > 20 mg for >3 weeks
    - Prednisolone >5mg at night-time > 2 weeks
    - Patient having clinical features of iatrogenic Cushing's 


- Q. What prednisolone dose cut-off is considered physiological as far as the HPA axis is concerned?
    - It is believed Prednisolone dose of 7.5 mg of equivalent or less does not cause HPA suppression
    - Dose equivalent to more than this can cause suppression


- Q. What are the physiological doses of steroids described above?
    - Hydrocortisone – 15-20 mg
    - Prednisolone- 5-7.5 mg


- Q. How long with tertiary adrenal insufficiency remain after steroid withdrawal in cases where the HPA axis is affected?
    - They remain for a long time
    - Often, for nine months after withdrawal of steroid


- #Real-life-cases


    - This is a patient taking medications from a local quack for generalized weakness from a quack for a long time. When the patient came to us, he had features of Cushing syndrome. On evaluation, we found he was taking an injection of DEXAMETHASONE from a local quack  (Patient permission taken for photographs)

- Investigations:

	1. S. Cortisol - <1.0 mcg/dl
	2. DHEAS- 8.3 mcg/dl (lower limits of normal is 56 mcg/dl)
	3. ACTH <5.0 pg/ml
