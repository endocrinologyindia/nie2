- Q. Which is the most common cause of Primary adrenal insufficiency currently?
    - Autoimmune


- Q. How common is tuberculosis as a cause of adrenal insufficiency?
    - Tuberculosis cause AI in 7-20% of cases


- **AUTOIMMUNE ADRENALITIS **


- Q. What are the sex differences in autoimmune adrenal insufficiency?
- Polyglandular syndrome occurs mainly female
- Isolated PAI
    - 1st 2 decades- M > F
    - 20-30 years- M = F
    - More than 30 year- F  > M


- Q. How common are 21-hydroxylase antibodies in autoimmune adrenalitis?
    - 86% of cases


- Q. What is the sequence of events that occur in autoimmune adrenalitis?
    - 1st increase in PRA and reduction in aldosterone  - Zona fasciculata damage
    - 2nd – reduction in cortisol response to ACTH
    - 3rd – Increase of ACTH
    - 4th – reduction of Cortisol and symptoms


- Q. Which test is the best predictor of adrenal insufficiency developing in patients having positive 21 hydroxylase antibodies?
    - ACTH is the best predictor of the development of AI


- Q. Which is the most common autoimmune disease associated with autoimmune adrenalitis ?
    - Ovarian failure, according to one study


- Q. Should all type 1 diabetic be screened for Adrenal insufficiency?
    - No
    - However, the risk of adrenal insufficiency is 1% in patients with type 1 diabetes


- **POLYGLANDULAR AUTOIMMUNE SYNDROME**


- Q. What are the features of APS I?
    - Adrenal insufficiency
    - Ectodermal dysplasia
    - Hypoparathyroidism
    - Mucocutaneous candidiasis


- Q. What is the gene defect in APS I?
    - AIRE gene
    - This is autoimmune recessive


- Q. Which is the 1st manifestation in APS-1?
    - Mucocutenous candidiasis


- Q. Which is the most common manifestation in APS-1?
    - Hypoparathyroidism


- Q.  Adrenal insufficiency occurs at what age?
    - 10-15 years of age


- Q. Which antibodies against adrenal steroidogenesis enzymes are present in APS-1?
    - 21 hydroxylase
    - 17 alpha-hydroxylase
    - Sidechain cleavage enzyme


- Q. Can hypogonadism occur in APS-1?
    - Yes
    - It is seen in 60% of the patients


- Q. What is the cause of malabsorption in APS-1?
    - Antibodies against tryptophan hydroxylase


- Q. Do type 1 diabetes and hypothyroidism occur in these conditions?
    - No
    - It is uncommon


- Q. What occurs 1st disease that occurs in APS 2- Adrenal insufficiency or Hypothyroidism/Diabetes mellitus?
    - 50% of cases PAI occurs first
    - Simultaneous detection – 30% of cases
    - Hypothyroidism /   Type 1 diabetes – 20% cases


- Q. Can hypoparathyroidism occur in APS-2?
    - No
    - It is not seen in APS-2


- Q. What about hypogonadism?
    - Hypogonadism can occur


- Q. What will you suspect if an APS-2 patient has low ACTH and other features of hypopituitarism?
    - Think of autoimmune hypophysitis


- Q. What antibodies cause vitiligo?
    - Antibody against tyrosinase enzyme and melanocyte-specific protein Pmel17


- **INFECTIOUS ADRENALITIS **


- Q. What kind of spread produces Tuberculous adrenalitis?
    - Hematogenous spread produces tuberculous adrenalitis


- Q. Which part of the adrenal is more damaged in tuberculous adrenalitis?
    - The medulla is destroyed more than the cortex


- Q. What happens to the size of adrenal glands in TB adrenalitis?
    - Initially increase in size
    - Then gradually reduces in size due to fibrosis


- Q. Can the adrenal function improve after AKT?
    - Usually no


- Q. How common is calcification seen in Tuberculous adrenalitis?
    - In 50% of cases


- Q. Can the adrenal size be enlarged in patients with tuberculosis even without have AI?
    - Yes
    - It increases in size before treatment and normalizes after treatment even without having adrenal insufficiency


- Q. Why do patients with tuberculosis of the adrenal gland worsen on treatment with AKT?
    - This is because of Rifampicin
    - This is a CYP3A4 inducer that increases the metabolism of Cortisol

- #Clinicalpearl
    - Patients with TB adrenalitis have active tuberculosis somewhere


- Q. Which fungal infections cause adrenalitis?
    - Histoplasmosis or Paracoccidomycosis (South American Blastomycosis)
    - It is rare in cryptococcosis, North American Blastomycosis, and coccidomycosis


- **ADRENAL HEMORRHAGE AND INFARCTION **


- Q. Which organisms are responsible for Waterhouse-Fredrickson syndrome?
    - Neisseria meningitiditis
    - Pseudomonas aeruginosa – most common organisms in one study
    - Neisseria gonorrhea
    - Streptococcus pneumonia
    - Staphylococcus aeruginosa


- Q. What is the cause of adrenal hemorrhage?
    - Anticoagulant therapy
    - Thromboembolic disease
    - APLA syndrome
    - Physical trauma
    - Sepsis
    - Postoperative state


- **METASTATIC DISEASE **


- Q. Why is metastasis to the adrenal gland common?
    - This is because it has a rich sinusoidal blood supply


- Q. Which primary malignancy of the adrenal gives a similar picture at metastasis?
    - Lymphoma


- Q. Which cancers are associated with adrenal metastasis?
    - Lung
    - Breast
    - Melanoma
    - Colon cancer
    - Stomach cancer


- Q. Are all metastasis to adrenals symptomatic?
    - No
    - Symptoms may not occur in all cases of adrenal metastasis
    - This is because the adrenal cortex needs to be destroyed significantly before symptoms occur


- **DRUG INDUCED PAI **


- Q. Which drugs block the steroidogenesis pathway leading to AI?
    - Etomidate
    - Ketoconazole
    - Fluconazole
    - Suramin
    - Metyrapone


- Q. Do all patients who receive these medications develop AI?
    - No
    - The inhibition of enzymes is partial
    - The Increase in ACTH override this partial enzyme inhibition
    - Hence patients with reduced pituitary or adrenal axis reserve develop AI


- Q. Which drugs cause AI by increasing the metabolism of Cortisol?
    - Baribiturtes
    - carbamazapine
    - Rifampicin
    - anticonvulsants
    - Phenytoin
    - Again they cause AI in patients who have limited reserves rather than in patients with adequate reserves


- Q. Which drug destroys the adrenal cortex leading to AI?
    - Mitotane


- Q. Can heparin cause AI?
    - Not directly
    - However, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with bilateral adrenal hemorrhage
