- Q. What are the differences in the HPA axis in Acute vs chronic critically ill patients?
    - Acute  there is activation of CRH → Increases ACTH→ increases Cortisol
    - Chronic → There is suppression of ACTH but cortisol is still high because it is produced by alternate pathways like endotoxins
- Q. What about Aldosterone ?
    - Acute illness  aldosterone is increased
    - Chronic illness→ aldosterone reduced
- **Effects of critical illness on  HPA Axis**
- Q. Describe with a diagram, changes in the HPA axis in critically ill patients.
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F7QXN8aeFbM.png?alt=media&token=89533162-0c63-4f8c-9ded-3bf3b6fb522c)
- Q. In terms of absolute values, what are the values of cortisol in normal vs critically ill patients?
    - Normal people have cortisol in the range of 5-24 mcg/dl
    - In critically ill- they are in the range of 40-50 mcg/dl
- Q. What factors produce an increase in cortisol in critically ill patients?
    - Activation of CRH due to stress –main
    - Reduction of CBG and albumin  increases free cortisol
    - Reduced GFR → increase half-life of cortisol
    - Inflammatory cytokine → increase peripheral conversion of cortisone to cortisol
    - Inflammatory cytokines → increase affinity to glucocorticoid receptors
    - Reduced breakdown of cortisol by downregulation of enzymes
- Q. What happens to CBG in sepsis?
    - In critically ill patients, CBG reduces
    - Hence free cortisol increases
    - Half-life of free cortisol is low
- Q. Describe the Negative feedback loop of cortisol in critically ill patients.
    - Inflammatory cytokines  increase Cortisol → suppress NK-kb transcription → reduce release of inflammatory cytokines
    - This is a negative feedback loop
- Q. What are the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in critically ill patients?
    - Increase catecholamine
    - Increase blood pressure
    - Keep cytokines in check
    - Produces insulin resistance both hepatic and peripheral  which provides more glucose for another purpose of fighting infection and stress
- **Acute stress **
- Q. Which 2 axes are activated in acute stress?
    - HPA axis
    - Sympathoadrenal axis
- Q. What is the prevalence of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients?
    - 10-20% in General
    - In septic shock- 60%
- Q. Is there a component of glucocorticoid resistance also?
    - Yes
    - Some believe that there is a phenomenon called “Systemic inflammation associated Glucocorticoid resistance”
    - This is well-known in COPD patients
    - In critical illness- ARDS patients tend to have this
- **ASSESSMENT OF ADRENAL RESERVE **
- Q. Is cortisol value associated with mortality in critically ill patients?
    - It is controversial and results are mixed
    - Both low and high cortisol have been associated with high mortality
- Q. What should be ideally measured in ICU-free cortisol or total cortisol?
    - Free cortisol is ideal
    - This is because CBG is reduced in critical illness
    - However, assays for free cortisol are not reliable and hence free cortisol is not normally tested in ICU
- Q. What is recommended in Williams for assessing adrenal function in critically ill?
    - 1.	Random Cortisol is done
        - a.	<15 ug/dl- Insufficient
        - b.	15-33 ug/dl- Do SST
        - c.	If >33 ug/dl- Sufficient
    - In SST- Failure of Cortisol to raise by >9 ug/dl- insufficiency present
    - These cutoffs are abandoned now, however, they have been used to determine prognosis
- Q. Describe the prognosis based on the results of the ACTH stimulation test.
    - Good prognosis
        - Baseline cortisol <34
        - Rise of cortisol > 9
        - 26% mortality at 28 days
    - Intermediate prognosis
        - Baseline cortisol >34
        - Rise of cortisol >9
        - Or
        - Baseline cortisol <34
        - Rise of cortisol <9
        - Mortality – 62%
    - Poor prognosis
        - Baseline cortisol >34 and rise <9
        - Mortality – 82%
- Q. Is there any role of low dose ACTH stimulation test?
    - Some studies have shown low-dose ACTH stimulation tests to be a better predictor than high-dose
    - There are subset of patients with adrenal insufficiency who would be missed by high-dose ACTH stimulation who are diagnosed with low-dose ACTH stimulation
- Q. Does the method of cortisol assay create an issue?
    - Yes
    - Cortisol measured with LC-MS/MS vs immunoassay has a poor correlation in critically ill patients
- **The Three Situations**
- Q. What are the three different situations that you have to understand while dealing with potential adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients?
    - 1. Patient with underlying Adrenal insufficiency becoming ill - having either adrenergic crisis or increased requirement of glucocorticoids
    - 2. Use of Glucocorticoids in refractory septic shock
    - 3. CIRCI- "Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency ” (CIRCI)
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FapN-uXLyMJ.png?alt=media&token=fc6931fb-af2f-4afc-8801-58dd656bbcbf)
- **Underlying Adrenal insufficiency**
- See notes on [[Notes in Endocrinology/ADRENAL GLAND/Adrenal insufficiency/Diagnosis of Adrenal insufficiency\|Diagnosis of Adrenal insufficiency]], [[Notes in Endocrinology/ADRENAL GLAND/Adrenal insufficiency/Treatment of Adrenal insufficiency\|Treatment of Adrenal insufficiency]]
- Q. What are the causes of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients?
    - Gram-negative and certain gram-positive infection
        - Use of Glucocorticoid use previously and suppression of HPA axis
        - Use of certain drugs
        - HIV infection
        - Adrenal infarct or hemorraghe
        - Pituitary apoplexy / Sheehan’s syndrome / other causes of Panhypopituitarism
- Q. Which drugs used in critically ill patients lead to poor cortisol response?
    - Etomidate- used for intubation
    - Ketoconazole
    - Anticonvulsants
    - Barbiturates
    - Rifampicin
- Q. What is Dr. Om J Lakhani's protocol for diagnosis of Adrenal insufficiency?
    - ![Pasted image 20240210155704.png](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240210155704.png)
- Q. Recommend preoperative steroid doses in patients with Adrenal insufficiency undergoing surgery?
    - 
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FMuE-iNPpRK.jpeg?alt=media&token=dd797459-864c-4352-ba3f-c9072e369511)
- Q. What is the volume status in primary vs secondary AI?
    - Primary AI- volume deficit
    - Secondary AI – Normal/ slightly increased volume status
    - Hypotension occurs in both cases
    - In primary AI  it is Mineralocorticoid deficiency leading to volume depletion which is the cause
    - In secondary AI → it is lack of pressor effect and lack of Epinephrine which is the cause
- Q. Which is the preferred glucocorticoid in adrenal crisis?
    - Hydrocortisone
- Q. Is mineralocorticoid required during an acute adrenal crisis?
    - Generally no
    - This is because the sodium-retaining ability of fludrocortisone takes 2-3 days to appear
    - Saline infusion solves the same purpose
    - Hence Mineralocorticoid is unnecessary in acute adrenal crisis
- Q. Describe the emergent treatment of adrenal crisis.
    - 1. Establish intravenous access with a large-gauge needle.
    - 2. Draw blood for immediate serum electrolytes and glucose and routine measurement of plasma cortisol and ACTH. Do not wait for lab results.
    - 3. Infuse 2 to 3 liters of isotonic saline or 5 percent dextrose in isotonic saline as quickly as possible. Frequent hemodynamic monitoring and measurement of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload.
    - 4. Give intravenous hydrocortisone, 100 mg immediately, and every six hours thereafter may be used.
    - 5. Use supportive measures as needed.
- Q. What is the subsequent management?
    - 1. Continue intravenous isotonic saline at a slower rate for the next 24 to 48 hours.
    - 2. Search for and treat possible infectious precipitating causes of the adrenal crisis.
    - 3. Perform a short ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, if the patient does not have known adrenal insufficiency.
    - 4. Determine the type of adrenal insufficiency and its cause if not already known.
    - 5. Taper parenteral glucocorticoid over one to three days, if precipitating or complicating illness permits, to oral glucocorticoid maintenance dose.
    - 6. Begin mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone, 0.1 mg by mouth daily, when saline infusion is stopped. (for Primary adrenal insufficiency)
- Q. What type of fluid should be avoided during initial resuscitation of an acute adrenal crisis?
    - Avoid hypotonic fluids as they can worsen the hyponatremia
- **Use of Glucorticoids in Refractory septic shock**
- Q. What is the current definition of Refractory septic shock?
    - The current definition of refractory septic shock is characterized by the following key points:
        - Persistently Low Mean Arterial Pressure: Despite volume resuscitation and titrated administration of vasopressors and inotropes, mean arterial pressure remains low in the context of a proven or suspected infection coupled with organ dysfunction 
        - High-Dose Vasopressor Therapy: Defined as an inadequate response to high-dose vasopressor therapy, which typically means more than 0.5 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or its equivalent 
        - Association with High Mortality Rate: Refractory septic shock carries a significantly high mortality rate, emphasizing the critical nature of this condition and the challenge it poses in clinical management.
- Q. What was the classical definition used in Clinical trials?
    - SBP <90 mm Hg despite 1 hour of adequate fluid and vasopressor administration
- Q. Describe the FRENCH trial in this area and what were the results.
    - The French trial randomly gave critically ill patients a placebo vs Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV /6 hrly + Fludrocortisone 50 mcg
    - They enrolled the patient within 8 hours of septic shock
    - Before starting they performed 250 mcg ACTH stimulation and defined patients as
        - Adequate adrenal reserve- raise of cortisol >9 mcg/dl
        - Inadequate adrenal reserve – the rise of cortisol </= 9 mcg/dl
    - Results
        - Patients in the intervention group had reduced mortality compared to the placebo overall
        - Patients having adequate adrenal reserve did not have any difference in mortality compared to placebo
        - Patients with inadequate adrenal reserve had more benefits compared to placebo
- Q. What is the CORTICUS trial and what were their results?
    - The trial was similar but the results were the opposite
    - They used hydrocortisone 50 mg IV /6 hrly with no fludrocortisone for 5 days and then tapered
    - They also did the ACTH stimulation and cutoff similar to the French trial
    - They found no difference in mortality in the hydrocortisone group
- Q. What was the difference between the French and CORTICUS trials?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FmJmQXknTsY.png?alt=media&token=26e11835-5037-4347-8864-e47541227863)
- Q. What does meta-analysis show?
    - Meta-analysis shows that corticosteroids are more beneficial for patients having severe pressor-dependent septic shock
- Q. What was the APROCCHHS trial?
    - In this trial involving patients with septic shock, 90-day all-cause mortality was lower among those who received hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone than among those who received placebo
- Q. Is corticosteroid beneficial in patients with less severe septic shock?
    - No
- Q. How is glucocorticoid administered in eligible patients?
    - Hydrocortisone – 50 mg IV /6 hrly (200 mg/day)
    An infusion of 10mg/hr can be given, which shows less glucose variability, however, mortality benefits are not known on infusion as most trials done on bolus
- Q. Is fludrocortisone required?
    - The COIITSS study found no difference in hydrocortisone alone vs H + fludrocortisone
    - Hence fludrocortisone is not recommended
    - High dose Hydrocortisone has good mineralocorticoid activity
- Q. How long to give?
    - This is not clearly defined
    - Generally given for 5-7 days
    - not stop abruptly – worsen hemodynamics – taper gradually
- Q. When to taper and when not to taper glucocorticoids for these patients?
    - To taper- when steroids used for >7 days → reduced to 50% doses → when hydrocortisone dose is <50 mg/day- can consider adding mineralocorticoid
    - When steroid use <7 days- no need to taper 
- Q. What is the current consensus about the use of Glucocorticoids in refractory septic shock?
    - **Key Points of Consensus**
        - **Potential Benefit:** There is evidence suggesting that low-dose, short-course glucocorticoids (specifically hydrocortisone) may offer benefits in refractory septic shock, including:
            - Faster resolution of shock
            - Reduction in the need for vasopressors
            - Potential improvement in survival rates
        - **Not a first-line Therapy:** Glucocorticoids are not recommended as a first-line treatment for septic shock. They are primarily used in refractory cases.
        - **Dosing and Duration:** Current recommendations favor low-dose hydrocortisone (often 200mg per day) for a short duration (typically up to 7 days).
        - **Potential Risks:** Glucocorticoid use comes with potential risks, including:
            - Increased risk of infections
            - Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
            - Gastrointestinal bleeding
- **CIRCI**
- Q. Who coined the term CIRCI?
    - Marik et al 
- Q. Give the concept of absolute vs relative adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients.
    - Absolute adrenal insufficiency – true adrenal insufficiency which is rare and seen in <3%
    - Most cases we see in ICU are relative adrenal insufficiency also known as “Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency ” (CIRCI)
    - This is the amount of cortisol required considering the critical illness condition is not sufficient
- Q. What is the correct term for relative Adrenal insufficiency in Critically ill patients?
    - It should be called  “Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency ” (CIRCI)
    - Terms absolute and relative adrenal insufficiency are avoided
- Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for CIRCI?
    - It is controversial
    - However, a consensus guideline by ‘The American college of Critical Care Medicine’ defines it as follows:
        - Baseline cortisol <10 mg/dl and/or
        - Rise in cortisol </= 9 mcg/dl after high dose ACTH stimulation test
- Q. What values of cortisol rule out Adrenal insufficiency?
    - Baseline >34 mcg/dl
    - Elevation of cortisol >9 mcg/dl over a baseline value
    The above rules out AI in critically ill patients
- Q. What are the conditions in which you should suspect CIRCI?
    - Hypotension
    - Unresponsiveness to catecholamine infusions
    - Ventilator dependence
    - Abdominal or flank pain
    - High fever with negative cultures and unresponsive to antibiotic therapy
    - Unexplained mental changes (i.e., apathy or depression)
    - Electrolyte abnormalities (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia)
    - Neutropenia, eosinophilia
    - Nausea, vomiting
- Q. Give the summary of guidelines from the Surgical Critical Care Net.

- Q. Summarize the diagnostic criteria for CIRCI with a diagram 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F3EEjeoqpjV.png?alt=media&token=d2ab348e-aed3-41fc-9de0-04ffafbd8f53)
- Q. How is ACTH stimulation done in this condition?
    - Baseline cortisol 
    - 250 mcg ACTH is given IM
    - after 60 minutes cortisol is repeated
- Q. What is the glucocorticoid dose recommendation for this condition?
    - Téblick et al recommend a lower dose in this setting of 60 mg /24 hours
- Q. What is the difference between CIRCI versus other situations in critical illness requiring glucocorticoids?
    - According to Téblick, CIRCI is more of a subacute to the chronic situation arising from a longer duration of critical illness
