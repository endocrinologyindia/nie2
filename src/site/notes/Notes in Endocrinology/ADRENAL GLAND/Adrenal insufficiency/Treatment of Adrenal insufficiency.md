- **Acute adrenal crisis **
- Q. What is the volume status in primary vs secondary AI?
    - Primary AI- volume deficit
    - Secondary AI – Normal/ slightly increased volume status
    - Hypotension occurs in both cases
    - In primary AI  it is Mineralocorticoid deficiency leading to volume depletion which is the cause
    - In secondary AI → it is lack of pressor effect and lack of Epinephrine which is the cause
- Q. Which is the preferred glucocorticoid in adrenal crisis?
    - Hydrocortisone
- Q. Is mineralocorticoid required during an acute adrenal crisis?
    - Generally no
    - This is because sodium retaining ability of fludrocortisone takes 2-3 days to appear
    - Saline infusion solves the same purpose
    - Hence Mineralocorticoid is unnecessary in acute adrenal crisis
- Q. Describe the emergent treatment of adrenal crisis.
    - 1. Establish intravenous access with a large-gauge needle.
    - 2. Draw blood for immediate serum electrolytes and glucose and routine measurement of plasma cortisol and ACTH. Do not wait for lab results.
    - 3. Infuse 2 to 3 liters of isotonic saline or 5 percent dextrose in isotonic saline as quickly as possible. Frequent hemodynamic monitoring and measurement of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload.
    - 4. Give intravenous hydrocortisone, 100 mg immediately, and every six hours thereafter may be used.
    - 5. Use supportive measures as needed.
- Q. What is the subsequent management?
    - 1. Continue intravenous isotonic saline at a slower rate for the next 24 to 48 hours.
    - 2. Search for and treat possible infectious precipitating causes of the adrenal crisis.
    - 3. Perform a short ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, if the patient does not have known adrenal insufficiency.
    - 4. Determine the type of adrenal insufficiency and its cause if not already known.
    - 5. Taper parenteral glucocorticoid over one to three days, if precipitating or complicating illness permits, to an oral glucocorticoid maintenance dose.
    - 6. Begin mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone, 0.1 mg by mouth daily, when the saline infusion is stopped. (for Primary adrenal insufficiency)
- Q. What type of fluid should be avoided during initial resuscitation of an acute adrenal crisis?
    - Avoid hypotonic fluids as they can worsen the hyponatremia
- **CHRONIC ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY**
- Q. Give the relative potency of various Glucocorticoid preparations.

- Q. What should be the dose of Hydrocortisone per day based on /m2 (useful for children)?
    - 10-12 mg/m2
- Q. What are the doses used if longer-acting preparations are used?
    - Dexamethasone – 0.5 mg
    - Prednisolone – 5 mg
- Q. What do endocrine society guidelines say about the choice of agent?
    - Prefer- hydrocortisone or cortisone
    - Prednisolone- alternate
    - Avoid dexamethasone – cushingoid side effects are often seen
- Q. What are the problems with long-acting agents?
    - Tendency for overtreatment
    - Also they tend to produce more BMD loss
- Q. In which cases are longer-acting preps preferred?
    - Patient noncompliant with treatment with multiple daily doses
    - Patient has late evening or early morning symptoms
- Q. Which drugs increase the requirement of Glucocorticoids?
    - Drugs that increase the CYP3A4 enzyme activity
    - These are
        - Rifampicin
        - Phenytoin
        - Barbiturates
- **MONITORING TREATMENT WITH HYDROCORTISONE **
- Q. What is the best method to monitor treatment?
    - Treatment should be monitored clinically
    - Cortisol day curve may be useful
- Q. When are samples taken to make a cortisol day curve?
    - Blood sample on arrival – noting the time
    - Before the lunchtime dose
        - 1 hr after lunchtime dose
    - Before the evening dose
        - 1 hr after the evening dose or 6 pm
- Q. What is the interpretation of the cortisol day curve?
    - Peak and trough
        - Peak <32 ug/dl and trough > 3.6 ug/dl
    - Rough guide to normal values
        - Morning peak – 18-28 ug/dl
        - Lunchtime peak cortisol- 14 – 18 ug/dl
        - Evening post-dose- 10-14 ug/dl
- Q. Is there a simpler way to monitor apart from using a day curve?
    - One paper suggests to measure Cortisol 4 hr after the morning hydrocortisone dose
    - The value should be within 10-90th percentile of the nomogram that they have created
- Q. What is Plenadren ?
    - It is dual release  hydrocortisone
    - It has an immediate release outer cover and slowly extended release core
- Q. How is it taken?
    - It is taken as one tablet in the morning
- Q. What are the advantages of Plenadren?
    - In one study the patients had better metabolic parameters- Lower BMI, HbA1c, weight gain, and blood pressure
- Q. What is the diavantage of Plenadren ?
    - Provides a very long period of almost no cortisol
    - Starting from evening time till morning there is negligible cortisol cover
- Q. What is Chronocort?
    - Chronocort is designed to have an early morning 4:00 am raise of cortisol which is what is physiologically seen
    - The patient takes 20 mg at bedtime and 10 mg in the morning at 7:00 am
- Q. Does the Dose of Fludrocortisone dependent on which steroid is taken?
    - With Hydrocortisone- 0.05 mg is sufficient
    - With Dexamethasone- 0.2 mg may be required
- Q. How does the environment affect the Floudrocortisone dose?

    - Newly diagnosed AI with unstable doses of Fludrocortisone
- Q. What are the symptoms of Mild Mineralocorticoid deficiency?
    - Nausea – mild
    - Salt craving
- Q. A patient is asymptomatic on Fludrocortisone of 100 mcg and potassium is normal. PRA is done which is 5 ng/ml/hr. Should the dose of Fludrocortisone be increased?
    - No
    - Do not increase the dose of Fludrocortisone if patient is asymptomatic
    - Clinical parameters should precede judgment based on PRA levels
- Q. A patient on Fludrocortisone develops hypertension. What should be done?
    - Reduce the dose of Fludrocortisone
    - If the patient continues to remain hypertensive – then it could be essential hypertension- add antihypertensive- except Spironolactone
- Q. What is the dose and benefit of the use of DHEA in Adrenal insufficiency?
    - It is used in a dose of 50 mg /day
    - It is thought to improve the quality of life in women
    - In women who report reduced quality of life despite being on Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid may be given DHEA trial for 6 months
    - Endocrine Society also recommends this trial
- Q. How is a dose of DHEA titrated?
    - Based on the Morning DHEA-S level before the medications
    - It should be targeted to mid normal range
- Q. Why do patients with secondary Adrenal insufficiency develop Cortisol deficiency on starting GH?
    - GH suppresses 11 beta HSD1 activity which converts cortisone to cortisol
- Q. What is 3 x 3 rule ?
    - In patients with AI, if they have a minor illness they can triple their dose of glucocorticoid for 3 days
    - This is 3 x 3 rule
    - If it fails to improve in 3 days then they need to consult a doctor
- Q. What is the dose of glucocorticoids that must be used during surgery?
    - Minor surgery – 25 mg of Hydrocortisone on the day of surgery
    - Moderate surgical stress (eg: cholecystectomy) – 50-75 mg on the day of surgery and post-op day 1
    - Major surgery – 100-150 mg on the day or surgery and ½ dose on the post of days 2 and 3- then return to baseline dose
- Q. What emergency injectable Glucocorticoid must be prescribed to the patient?
    - Hydrocortisone 100 mg or Dexamethasone 4 mg must be prescribed to the patient and the patient’s relatives must be taught how to inject it in case of emergency

    - Injury leading to blood loss of more than 1 cup
    - Fracture
    - Patient unresponsive
    - Severe nausea and vomiting

    - 100 mg /6hrly during delivery or infusion during delivery
    - Taper to the previous dose in 2-3 days
- Q. What is the effect of Progesterone on the RAAS axis?
    - Progesterone competes with aldosterone for binding to Mineralocorticoid receptor

- Q. Overall, what happens to aldosterone and renin in pregnancy?
    - Aldosterone and renin increase during normal pregnancy
- Q. How is fludrocortisone dose adjusted in pregnancy?
    - PRA may guide therapy
    - However do not try to suppress to pre-pregnancy range

    - They say the quality of life is worse with PAI despite optimal therapy
    - Mortality may be increased but data is uncertain
- #Pearl
    - Fludrocortisone has a long half-life and can even be given on alternate days
- Q. Which form of Hydrocortisone is preferred for an emergency?
    - Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate
