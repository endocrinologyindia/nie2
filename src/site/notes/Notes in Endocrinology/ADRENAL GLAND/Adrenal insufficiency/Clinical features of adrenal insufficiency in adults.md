- Q. What are the features of glucocorticoid deficiency?
    - Gastrointestinal symptoms- nausea and vomiting
    - Fasting hypoglycemia
    - Fatigue and weakness
    - Failure to thrive in an infant
    - Morning headache
    - Reduce free water clearance


- Q. What are the causes of Mineralocorticoid deficiency?
    - Hypotension, syncope, and dizziness
    - Dehydration
    - Salt craving
    - Muscle weakness
    - Weight loss
    - Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms- nausea and vomiting
    - Electrolyte imbalance


- #Clinicalpearl
    - GI symptoms and weight loss (or failure to thrive in infant) are because of both Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid


- Q. What are the features of Adrenal androgen deficiency?
    - Males and prepubertal children- No symptoms
    - Post pubertal females- absence of axillary and pubic hair, no libido


- Q. Hypoglycemia is a prominent feature of primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency?
    - It is a prominent feature of secondary adrenal insufficiency


- Q. Which hormone is responsible for the acute adrenal crisis- Mineralocorticoid or Glucocorticoid?
    - Mineralocorticoid are primarily responsible for the acute adrenal crisis
    - Hence acute adrenal problem can also occur in patients who are on glucocorticoid replacement due to mineralocorticoid insufficiency


- Q. Can patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency present with adrenal crisis ?
    - Generally is is less common because of normal mineralocorticoid
    - However, Glucocorticoid deficiency alone can lead to hypotension


- Q. How does isolated glucocorticoid deficiency produce hypotension?
    - Reduced action of PNMT enzyme- which converts norepinephrine to epinephrine
    - Reduce vascular response to angiotensin II and Norepinephrine
    - Reduced synthesis of angiotensinogen
    - Increase prostacyclin production


- Q. What is the feature of abdominal pain in PAI, and what is the cause?
    - It is generalized abdominal pain
    - The exact cause is not known
    - Possibly since it is because of autoimmune disease- it may be due to Serositis


- Q. What is the relation between fever and PAI?
    - Fever is exacerbated by hypocortisolemia


- Q. What are the features of Chronic Adrenal insufficiency?
    - Fatigue, Malaise and weakness
        - Fatigue that is worsened by exertion and improved with bed rest
        - Weakness that is generalized, not limited to particular muscle groups
    - Anorexia
    - Weight loss


- Q. How much weight loss is seen?
    - Weight loss is about 2-5 kg


- Q. What are the GI symptoms of Adrenal insufficiency ?
    - Nausea
    - Diarrhea alternating with constipation
    - Vomiting
    - Abdominal pain
        - Abdominal pain and vomiting may herald an adrenal crisis


- Q. What is the cause of the GI symptoms?
    - It is not known


- Q. Is postural hypotension seen in these patients?
    - Yes


- Q. Can a hypertensive patient have Primary adrenal insufficiency?
    - Unlikely
    - The presence of hypertension is a strong evidence against PAI


- Q. How common is hyponatremia, and how does it manifest?
    - Hyponatremia is very common, it is seen in 90% of cases
    - Salt craving is also expected and also increase the thirst for iced liquids


- Q. How common are hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis in PAI?
    - Present in 60-65% of cases


- Q. Is hypercalcemia common ?
    - It is present but rare


- Q. Why is insulin sensitivity increased in PAI?
    - Loss of gluconeogenic effect of Cortisol
    - Loss of effect of epinephrine to increase blood sugar


- Q. Which patients tend to have hypoglycemia in Adrenal insufficiency?
    - It is mainly fasting [[Hypoglycemia\|Hypoglycemia]]
    - It is more common in secondary adrenal insufficiency
    - Also more common in infants and children
    - Also seen in patients with Type 1 diabetes


- Q. Which POMC product is a stronger stimulant of melanogenesis than MSH?
	- ACTH 1-17


- Q. Is the POMC system present in the skin?
    - Yes, it is present in keratinocytes
    - It produces MSH locally


- Q. What are the areas of hyperpigmentation in primary adrenal insufficiency?
    - Areas of sun exposure
        - Face
        - Neck
        - Back of hands
    - Areas exposed to friction
        - Straps for socks
        - Elbow
        - Knee
        - Knuckles
        - Waist (belt)
        - Bra straps
    - Normally pigmentated area
        - Areola
        - Axilla
        - Perineum
        - Umbilicus
        - Others
        - Palmar crease
        - Existing freckles may become darker, new freckles may appear
    - Oral
        - The inner surface of the tongue
        - Buccal mucosa- along line of dental occlusion
    - Hairs may become darker
    - Nails may show dark bands
    - Pigmentation often is patchy


- Q. What happens to the scars?
    - Scars acquired during PAI – remain hyperpigmented
    - Scars acquired before PAI- normal pigmentation
    - Scars acquired on PAI treatment- normal


- Q. Does the hyperpigmentation disappear with treatment?
    - Yes it does
    - In hairs and nails, it disappears slowly
    - Also, it doesn't disappear from scars are melanocytes are trapped into the fibrous connective tissue


- Q. Is sexual dysfunction seen in PAI?
    - Only In women
    - This is because of the loss of adrenal androgens
    - It does not occur in men who have androgens produced by testis as well


- Q. How common is amenorrhea?
    - Seen in 25% of cases
    - Note possibility of [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)\|Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)]] in these cases


- Q. What are the musculoskeletal symptoms?
    - Myalgia and arthralgia are common
    - So much so that they even develop contractures


- Q. What happens to the 'ear' in PAI?
    - Calcification of the auricular cartilage is seen in long-standing primary and secondary Adrenal insufficiency
    - It is mainly seen in men
    - It does not improve with treatment with Glucocorticoid


- Q. What are the psychiatric symptoms of Adrenal insufficiency?
    - Impairment of memory that can progress to confusion, delirium, and stupor
    - Depression manifested by apathy, poverty of thought, and lack of initiative
    - Psychosis, manifested by social withdrawal, irritability, negativism, poor judgment, agitation, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and bizarre or catatonic posturing


- Q. Can PAI lead to vitiligo?
    - Vitiligo may be often associated with PAI
    - In autoimmune Adrenal insufficiency – vitiligo may be one of the autoimmune disease associated
    - Autoimmune destruction of dermal melanocytes may lead to de novo vitiligo in patients with PAI


- Q. Which other findings would you look for?
    - Splenomegaly is present
    - Enlargement of tonsils – often seen


- Q. What is the importance of eosinophilia in PAI?
    - Thorn et al described relative eosinophilia as a feature of PAI
    - However, eosinophils  > 500 /um3 were seen only in < 20% of patients with PAI


- Q. Why is hypoglycemia more common in secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency?
    - Probably because of lack of dehydration and Mineralocorticoid deficiency, the patient can tolerate the disease longer
    - hence they come with hypoglycemia, whereas patients with PAI come with Mineralocorticoid deficiency features
    - It was earlier believed it is because of Growth hormone deficiency associated- however it is also seen in isolated ACTH deficiencies also


- Q. Are GI symptoms common in secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency?
    - No
    - They are uncommon


- Q. Which other conditions lead to hyperpigmentation similar to that seen in PAI?
    - Antimalarial use
    - Antineoplastic agents
    - Zidovudine
    - Hemochromatosis
    - Tetracycline
    - Phenothiazine


- Q. How will you differentiate PAI from hemochromatosis based on pigmentation?
    - PAI has the pigmentation of oral mucosa while hemochromatosis does not
- #Clinicalpearl
    - Bilateral Adrenal enlargement incidentally detected may be a clue to Adrenal insufficiency


- Q. Which CYP metabolizes Cortisol?
    - CYP3A4


- Q. Which addictive substances produce Adrenal insufficiency?
    - Opioids
