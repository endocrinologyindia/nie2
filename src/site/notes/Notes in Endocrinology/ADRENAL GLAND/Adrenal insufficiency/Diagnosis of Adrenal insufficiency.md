- **ESTABLISHING THE DIAGNOSIS **


- Q. What morning cortisol value should be used for the diagnosis of Primary adrenal insufficiency [PAI] ?
    - < 5 mcg/dl – 100% specificity but less sensitivity
    - This is the cutoff recommended by the Endocrine society
    - However value of <3 ug/dl is suggested by other experts


- Q. What upper limit of cortisol value rules out adrenal insufficiency ?
    - This is debatable
    - Some say 10.8 ug/dl and some say 17 ug/dl
    - However upper limit should not be used for diagnostic consideration


- Q. Can morning salivary cortisol be used for diagnosis ?
- Yes but it has not been validated
    - Value <1.8 ng/ml- most likely adrenal insufficiency is present
    - Value >5.8 ng/ml – rules out


- Q. Does 4 pm cortisol have any value ?
    - No


- Q. Is Cosyntropin a complete ACTH molecule ?
    - No
    - It is ACTH – 1-24 amino acids
    - Normal ACTH is 1-39 aminoacids
    - However it has full biological potency


- Q. Is it necessary to perform ACTH stimulation in the morning ?
    - No
    - However, normal people have highest cortisol response in the morning
    - Hence doing the test in the morning would improve specificity and avoid false positive


- Q. How is the low dose ACTH stimulation test performed ?
    - Get baseline cortisol first – no further testing required in the following conditions
        - S. Cortisol <3.6  ug/dl-  Definitely low  (NEW ENDOCRINE SOCIETY GUIDELINES)
        - S. cortisol >15 ug/dl- Definitely normal
    - For Baseline cortisol 3- 15 ug/dl perform Low doe ACTH stimulation test
        - Give 1 ug of Cosyntropin IV – 1 unit in 100 IU insulin syringe
            - Insulin syringe can used for the purpose
            - 250 ug (2ml) of Cosyntropin is diluted in 250 ml of normal saline giving it a ratio of 1 ug/ml
            - Take 1 ml of this in insulin syringe  (alternatively dilute in 500 ml of normal saline and take 2 ml in a normal 5 cc syringe)
            - 1 ml (1ug/ml dilution) is injected IV
        - Repeat Cortisol after 20 and 30 min
            - If peak cortisol >21.7 ug/dl – then suggestive of normal response  (18 ug/dl according to Endocrine society guidelines)


- Q. Why is cortisol collected at 20 min also in low dose ACTH stimulation ?
    - Because peak may be achieved earlier


- Q. In which conditions is low dose ACTH stimulation test useful ?
    - Recent secondary Adrenal insufficiency- eg: after pituitary surgery- within 1-2 weeks (< 4 month of Pituitary surgery)
    - Chronic partial pituitary AI


- Q. When should 250 ug dose ACTH stimulation be performed after pituitary  surgery ?
    - It is reliable 4 months after pituitary surgery
    - Or 9 months after radiation therapy


- **ESTABLISHING THE LEVEL OF DEFECT **


- Q. What is the lab method for testing of ACTH ?
    - 2 site chemiluminiscent assay


- Q. What is the normal value of ACTH using 2 site chemiluminescent assay ?
    - It is 20-52 pg/ml


- Q. What ACTH value favors primary and what favours secondary adrenal insufficiency ?
    - More than 100 pg/ml- primary
    - <20 pg/ml- Secondary adrenal insufficiency
    - 20-100 pg/ml- gray zone


- Q. When should ACTH sample be drawn ?
    - Ideally before the treatment is started
    - However is treatment is already started then 24 hours after last dose of hydrocortisone and longer duration after last dose of dexamethasone
    - Alternatively, switch to hydrocortisone from dexamethasone for several days before measuring ACTH if dexamethasone is used


- Q. What is principle of a prolonged ACTH stimulation test ?
    - Atropic adrenal glands in secondary and tertiary AI may not respond to single ACTH stimulation but may respond to prolonged ACTH stimulation test
    - While in primary AI – they don’t respond to prolonged ACTH stimulation
    - Hence it helps distinguish primary from secondary/tertiary AI


- Q. What is the principle of Metyrapone test ?
    - Metyrapone block 11 beta hydroxylase  reduced Cortisol further → stimulates ACTH → increase of 11 deoxycortisol


- Q. What is the use of metyrapone stimulation test ?
    - It is used for diagnosis of partial ACTH deficiency which may be missed with ACTH stimulation or even ITT


- Q. Why does metyrapone stimulation detect partial ACTH deficiency which is missed by ITT ?
    - Hypoglycemia is a more potent stimulant for ACTH release than hypocortisolemia
    - Hence ITT may lead to normal response in patients with partial ACTH defect


- Q. What is the use of CRH Stimulation test ?
    - It is used to differentiate secondary from tertiary AI
    - ACTH increases in repsonse to CRH in tertiary AI while it does not in secondary AI


- Q. Is insulin tolerance test really required to make the diagnosis of AI ?
    - Generally no  unless it is also done to test for GH deficiency or in very recent ACTH defect


- Q. So which test to use in secondary AI ?
    - Chronic secondary AI- high dose ACTH stimulation test (4 month after pituitary surgery)
    - Acute secondary AI- Low dose ACTH stimulation test / ITT
    - Partial ACTH deficiency – Metyrapone stimulation test


- **USE OF ACTH STIMULATION TESTS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY **


- Q. Can Cosyntropin for low dose be given IM ?
    - No
    - For the full dose both IM and IV is possible
    - For low dose IM has not been evaluated


- Q. Is 1mg standard dose for Low dose ACTH stimulation or lower dose can be used ?
    - 0.5 mg/1.73 m2 has also been tested


- Q. How is solution for 1 ug/ml made ?
    - a.	Take 0.2 ml of Cosyntropin 250 ug/ml is taken with Tuberculin/insulin syringe (0.2 ml ml will be 20 units in insulin syringe of 100 IU)
    - b.	This is injected into 25 ml of normal saline – this makes it a solution of 2 ug/ml
    - c.	0.5ml pf this solution is taken and shaken thoroughly and injected IV using the same syringe


- Q. What cut off must be used if IM injection of Cosyntropin is used instead of IV ?
    - One paper suggests a lower cut off of 16 ug/dl instead of 18 ug/dl for high dose ACTH stimulation test used IM instead of IV


- Q. Summarize the role of various test in diagnosis of Adrenal insufficiency ?
    - 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test-
        - Diagnosis of Primary AI
        - Diagnosis of Secondary AI > 4 months after pituitary surgery
    - 1 mcg ACTH stimulation test
        - Diagnosis of PAI (same sensitivity as 250 mcg)
        - Diagnosis of Acute ACTH deficiency (SAI) <4 months after surgery
    - 3. Prolonged ACTH stimulation test- Differentiate Primary from Secondary AI
    - 4. Metyrapone stimulation test- Diagnosis of partial ACTH deficiency
    - 5. CRH stimulation test- distinguish secondary and tertiary AI
    - 6. Insulin tolerance test- gold standard- used to evaluate entire HPA axis


- Q. What are the precuautions taken before using metyrapone stimulation test ?
    - Must be done in indoor setup as it leads to further reduction of cortisol
    - Leads to nausea and vomiting- avoid in patients with severe AI


- Q. How is metyrapone stimulation test performed ?
    - Earlier it was performed over 3 days
    - Now it is done overnight
    - Metyrapone 30 mg/kg (750 mg) is given at midnight
    - ACTH, Cortisol and 11 deoxycortisol is measured at 8:00 am in the morning


- Q. What is normal response ?
    - Normal values
        - ACTH >100 pg/ml
        - 11 deoxycortisol - > 7 ug/dl
        - Cortisol < 5 ug/dl


- Q. What suggest adrenal insufficiency ?
    - 11 Deoxycortisol < 7 ug/dl
    - Cortisol < 5 ug/dl
    - This is diagnostic of PAI


- Q. What is the importance of the ACTH value in metyrapone stimulation test ?
    - It can help differentiate primary from secondary AI
    - However the values overlap with normal individual hence it cannot be used if patient is not established to have AI
    - In Partial Secondary AI – ACTH value is 10-200 pg/ml
    - In PAI - >200 pg/ml


- Q. Can conventional Immunoassay be used in this test ?
    - No it cannot be used because cortisol and 11 Deoxycortisol may cross react
    - Hence it is better to use LC-MS/MS


- Q. Can this test be used in Cushing’s syndrome ?
    - Yes
    - It can be used to distinguish Pituitary from Ectopic Cushing’s


- Q. How does it help in ACTH-dependent Cushing’s?
    - In Ectopic Cushing's – the natural HPA Axis is suppressed- hence the there is negative response (failure of 11 Dexocycortisol) to raise to Metyrapone
    - In Pituitary Cushing’s  - ACTH increases hence It responds


- Q. Can DHEAS be used to make a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency ?
    - Yes
    - DHEAS <60 ug/dl goes in favour of adrenal insufficiency
    - Also in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency early- DHEAS response to low dose ACTH is lost first before cortisol response
    - Hence stimulated DHEAS can be used for early diagnosis of secondary AI

- Q. What is the role of low dose ACTH stimulation test done using ACTON Prolongatum (Porcine sequence corticotropin) ?
    - A study conducted by Appaiah et al found that the use of low dose of ACTON prolongatum in the dose of 6 units achieves the same objective as a higher dose (24 units) of the same
- Q. What is the new protocol for ACTH stimulation test as suggested in the paper ?
    - Take a baseline cortisol sample
    - Administer 6 units of ACTON Prolongatum (Porcine sequence corticotropin) intramuscularly
    - Take samples for the Cortisol at 30 and 60 minutes
    - Use the same cut-off >18 mcg/dl as suggested earlier
