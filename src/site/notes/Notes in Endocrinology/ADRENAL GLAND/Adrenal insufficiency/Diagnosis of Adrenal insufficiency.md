**ESTABLISHING THE DIAGNOSIS**

- Q. What morning cortisol value should be used for the diagnosis of Primary adrenal insufficiency [PAI]?
    - < 5 mcg/dl – 100% specificity but less sensitivity
    - This is the cutoff recommended by the Endocrine society
    - However, a value of <3 ug/dl is suggested by other experts

- Q. What upper limit of cortisol value rules out adrenal insufficiency?
    - This is debatable
    - Some say 10.8 ug/dl and some say 17 ug/dl
    - However, the upper limit should not be used for diagnostic consideration

- Q. Can morning salivary cortisol be used for diagnosis?
    - Yes, but it has not been validated
    - Value <1.8 ng/ml - most likely adrenal insufficiency is present
    - Value >5.8 ng/ml – rules out

- Q. Does 4 pm cortisol have any value?
    - No

- Q. Is Cosyntropin a complete ACTH molecule?
    - No
    - It is ACTH – 1-24 amino acids
    - Normal ACTH is 1-39 amino acids
    - However, it has full biological potency

- Q. Is it necessary to perform ACTH stimulation in the morning?
    - No
    - However, normal people have the highest cortisol response in the morning
    - Hence, doing the test in the morning would improve specificity and avoid false positives

- Q. How is the low dose ACTH stimulation test performed?
    - Get baseline cortisol first – no further testing required in the following conditions
        - S. Cortisol <3.6 ug/dl - Definitely low (NEW ENDOCRINE SOCIETY GUIDELINES)
        - S. cortisol >15 ug/dl - Definitely normal
    - For Baseline cortisol 3 - 15 ug/dl perform Low dose ACTH stimulation test
        - Give 1 ug of Cosyntropin IV – 1 unit in 100 IU insulin syringe
            - Insulin syringe can be used for this purpose
            - 250 ug (2ml) of Cosyntropin is diluted in 250 ml of normal saline, giving a ratio of 1 ug/ml
            - Take 1 ml of this in an insulin syringe (alternatively, dilute in 500 ml of normal saline and take 2 ml in a normal 5 cc syringe)
            - 1 ml (1ug/ml dilution) is injected IV
        - Repeat Cortisol after 20 and 30 min
            - If peak cortisol >21.7 ug/dl – then suggestive of normal response (18 ug/dl according to Endocrine society guidelines)

- Q. Why is cortisol collected at 20 min also in low dose ACTH stimulation?
    - Because the peak may be achieved earlier

- Q. In which conditions is the low dose ACTH stimulation test useful?
    - Recent secondary Adrenal insufficiency - e.g., after pituitary surgery - within 1-2 weeks (< 4 months of Pituitary surgery)
    - Chronic partial pituitary AI

- Q. When should the 250 ug dose ACTH stimulation be performed after pituitary surgery?
    - It is reliable 4 months after pituitary surgery
    - Or 9 months after radiation therapy

**ESTABLISHING THE LEVEL OF DEFECT**

- Q. What is the lab method for testing of ACTH?
    - 2 site chemiluminescent assay

- Q. What is the normal value of ACTH using the 2 site chemiluminescent assay?
    - It is 20-52 pg/ml

- Q. What ACTH value favors primary and what favors secondary adrenal insufficiency?
    - More than 100 pg/ml - primary
    - <20 pg/ml - Secondary adrenal insufficiency
    - 20-100 pg/ml - gray zone

- Q. When should the ACTH sample be drawn?
    - Ideally, before the treatment is started
    - However, if treatment is already started, then 24 hours after the last dose of hydrocortisone and a longer duration after the last dose of dexamethasone
    - Alternatively, switch to hydrocortisone from dexamethasone for several days before measuring ACTH if dexamethasone is used

- Q. What is the principle of a prolonged ACTH stimulation test?
    - Atrophic adrenal glands in secondary and tertiary AI may not respond to a single ACTH stimulation but may respond to a prolonged ACTH stimulation test
    - While in primary AI – they don't respond to prolonged ACTH stimulation
    - Hence, it helps distinguish primary from secondary/tertiary AI

- Q. What is the principle of the Metyrapone test?
    - Metyrapone blocks 11 beta hydroxylase, reducing Cortisol further → stimulates ACTH → increase of 11 deoxycortisol

- Q. What is the use of the metyrapone stimulation test?
    - It is used for the diagnosis of partial ACTH deficiency, which may be missed with ACTH stimulation or even ITT

- Q. Why does the metyrapone stimulation detect partial ACTH deficiency, which is missed by ITT?
    - Hypoglycemia is a more potent stimulant for ACTH release than hypocortisolemia
    - Hence, ITT may lead to a normal response in patients with partial ACTH defect

- Q. What is the use of the CRH Stimulation test?
    - It is used to differentiate secondary from tertiary AI
    - ACTH increases in response to CRH in tertiary AI, while it does not in secondary AI

- Q. Is the insulin tolerance test really required to make the diagnosis of AI?
    - Generally no, unless it is also done to test for GH deficiency or in a very recent ACTH defect

- Q. So which test to use in secondary AI?
    - Chronic secondary AI - high dose ACTH stimulation test (4 months after pituitary surgery)
    - Acute secondary AI - Low dose ACTH stimulation test / ITT
    - Partial ACTH deficiency – Metyrapone stimulation test

**USE OF ACTH STIMULATION TESTS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY**

- Q. Can Cosyntropin for a low dose be given IM?
    - No
    - For the full dose, both IM and IV are possible
    - For a low dose, IM has not been evaluated

- Q. Is 1mg the standard dose for Low dose ACTH stimulation, or can a lower dose be used?
    - 0.5 mg/1.73 m2 has also been tested

- Q. How is the solution for 1 ug/ml made?
    - a. Take 0.2 ml of Cosyntropin 250 ug/ml with a Tuberculin/insulin syringe (0.2 ml will be 20 units in an insulin syringe of 100 IU)
    - b. This is injected into 25 ml of normal saline – this makes it a solution of 2 ug/ml
    - c. 0.5ml of this solution is taken and shaken thoroughly and injected IV using the same syringe

- Q. What cut off must be used if the IM injection of Cosyntropin is used instead of IV?
    - One paper suggests a lower cut off of 16 ug/dl instead of 18 ug/dl for the high dose ACTH stimulation test used IM instead of IV

- Q. Summarize the role of various tests in the diagnosis of Adrenal insufficiency?
    - 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test-
        - Diagnosis of Primary AI
        - Diagnosis of Secondary AI > 4 months after pituitary surgery
    - 1 mcg ACTH stimulation test
        - Diagnosis of PAI (same sensitivity as 250 mcg)
        - Diagnosis of Acute ACTH deficiency (SAI) <4 months after surgery
    - Prolonged ACTH stimulation test - Differentiate Primary from Secondary AI
    - Metyrapone stimulation test - Diagnosis of partial ACTH deficiency
    - CRH stimulation test - distinguish secondary and tertiary AI
    - Insulin tolerance test - gold standard - used to evaluate the entire HPA axis

- Q. What are the precautions taken before using the metyrapone stimulation test?
    - Must be done in an indoor setup as it leads to further reduction of cortisol
    - Leads to nausea and vomiting - avoid in patients with severe AI

- Q. How is the metyrapone stimulation test performed?
    - Earlier it was performed over 3 days
    - Now it is done overnight
    - Metyrapone 30 mg/kg (750 mg) is given at midnight
    - ACTH, Cortisol, and 11 deoxycortisol are measured at 8:00 am in the morning

- Q. What is the normal response?
    - Normal values
        - ACTH >100 pg/ml
        - 11 deoxycortisol - > 7 ug/dl
        - Cortisol < 5 ug/dl

- Q. What suggests adrenal insufficiency?
    - 11 Deoxycortisol < 7 ug/dl
    - Cortisol < 5 ug/dl
    - This is diagnostic of PAI

- Q. What is the importance of the ACTH value in the metyrapone stimulation test?
    - It can help differentiate primary from secondary AI
    - However, the values overlap with normal individuals, hence it cannot be used if the patient is not established to have AI
    - In Partial Secondary AI – ACTH value is 10-200 pg/ml
    - In PAI - >200 pg/ml

- Q. Can a conventional Immunoassay be used in this test?
    - No, it cannot be used because cortisol and 11 Deoxycortisol may cross-react
    - Hence, it is better to use LC-MS/MS

- Q. Can this test be used in Cushing's syndrome?
    - Yes
    - It can be used to distinguish Pituitary from Ectopic Cushing's

- Q. How does it help in ACTH-dependent Cushing's?
    - In Ectopic Cushing's – the natural HPA Axis is suppressed - hence there is a negative response (failure of 11 Deoxycortisol to raise) to Metyrapone
    - In Pituitary Cushing's - ACTH increases, hence it responds

- Q. Can DHEAS be used to make a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency?
    - Yes
    - DHEAS <60 ug/dl goes in favor of adrenal insufficiency
    - Also, in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency early - the DHEAS response to low dose ACTH is lost first before the cortisol response
    - Hence, stimulated DHEAS can be used for early diagnosis of secondary AI

**UPDATES - 06-Jan-2024**

- Q. What is the role of the low dose ACTH stimulation test done using ACTON Prolongatum (Porcine sequence corticotropin)?
    - A study conducted by Appaiah et al found that the use of a low dose of ACTON prolongatum in the dose of 6 units achieves the same objective as a higher dose (24 units) of the same

- Q. What is the new protocol for the ACTH stimulation test as suggested in the paper?
    - Take a baseline cortisol sample
    - Administer 6 units of ACTON Prolongatum (Porcine sequence corticotropin) intramuscularly
    - Take samples for the Cortisol at 30 and 60 minutes
    - Use the same cut-off >18 mcg/dl as suggested earlier
