- Q. Enlist the uses of Growth hormone (GH) in children?
    - GH deficiency
    - Idiopathic short stature
    - Small for gestational age
    - Turner’s syndrome
    - CRF
    - Prader Willi
    - Noonan’s syndrome
    - Short stature with SHOX deficiency


- Q. What is the effect of GH and insulin on Fatty acid?
    - They have opposite actions
    - Insulin promotes Free fatty acid synthesis
    - GH mobilizes fatty acid from the periphery


- #Clinicalpearl
    - GH increases protein and muscles mass
    - Reduces fat mass


- Q. What is the effect of GH on cartilage?
    - It enhances cartilage growth


- Q. What type of GH is used in therapy at present?
    - Aqueous solution of recombinant human growth hormone injected subcutaneously


- Q. Is it effective if given on alternate days?
    - Daily therapy is more effective than alternate day therapy, even if the same weekly dose is used


- Q. Is sustained-release preparation given weekly effective?
    - It is as effective as daily preparation


- **Use of growth hormone **


- Q. When is the best age to start treatment?
    - As young as possible


- Q. What is the starting dose in children?
    - Norditropin recommends 25-35 ug/kg/day in children (same dose recommended by guidelines)
    - However, uptodate recommends a starting dose of 40 mcg/kg/day
    - A lower dose can be used in children with severe GH deficiency since they are more sensitive to GH (20 ug/kg/day)


- Q. Which patients require a higher dose?
    - Turner and CRF patient
    - They have  a degree of GH deficiency
    - During puberty


- Q. What are the doses during puberty?
    - Doses as high as 100 ug/kg/day may be required during puberty


#Keypoints

-3 IU = 1 mg (dose conversion)
    - Dose in children – 25-35 ug/kg/day (0.07-0.1 iu/kg/day)
    - Turner’s = 50 ug/kg/day
    - In adults- 0.15- 0.3 mg/day

	
     
- Q. What is the best time to administer GH?
    - Traditionally given in the evening or at bedtime
    - But no evidence that that is better


- Q.  How to monitor therapy and titrate dose?
    - Repeat IGF1 -4-6 week after starting GH
    - Keep IGF1 about 1 SD above the mean
    - If IGF1 is low, increase the dose and vice versa
    - Monitor GH after six month – then that is considered an important parameter
    - Note
        - The IGF1 based dosing is not recommended by guidelines (This is the idea of Cohen et al.)
        - They recommend doing IGF1 once  a year
        - IGF1 based dosing is controversial; however, Cohen’s studies show they are not only safe and effective but also efficient in terms of the dose of GH required


- Q. What to do if IGF1 is high, but GV is good?
    - Lower the dose slightly by 20%


- Q. Is IGF1 used for monitoring therapy in children with Idiopathic short stature also?
    - Yes
    - But ISS require a slightly higher dose to maintain the same IGF1 than GH deficient children


- Q. What is defined as a good response to therapy based on Growth velocity?
    - See the GV, 6 months after starting treatment. Two approaches are useful
        - If GV charts for children with GH deficiency are available – then keep the GV 1SD above the mean
        - If they are not available, use GV  charts of normal children  and try and get the GV, above the 75th percentile


- Q. Summarize the follow up investigations ?
    - IGF1 – 4-6 weeks after starting treatment
    - GV calculated 6 months after starting treatment 
    - IGF1 – repeat 6-12 monthly
    - GV- check every 6 months


- Q. How , when and why is thyroid function checked ?
    - Check thyroid function 1 year after starting therapy
    - Treatment with GH can lead to treatment-related hypothyroidism- though this is rare
    - Hypothyroidism is central hence T4 must also be measured


- Q. What are the causes of poor response to treatment ?
    - Poor compliance
    - GH insensitivity
    - GH antibody (rare)
    - Concurrent glucocorticoid use
    - Incorrect dosing
    - Incorrect diagnosis
    - Concurrent hypothyroidism – untreated


- Q. Which patients develop GH antibody ?
    - Patients with GH 1A deficiency typically develop GH antibodies


- Q. When to suspect GH antibody ?
    - Patient having an initially good response to GH but then the response to GH suddenly stops
    - Check the anti-GH antibody and also mutation analysis for GH1 mutation


- **Expected response to GH therapy **


- Q. Is the increase in growth rate with GH therapy proportional to the dose ?
    - No
    - Different people have different response to GH


- Q. Which databases have provided information on response to GH therapy ?
    - Pfizer international growth database (previously called KIGS)
    - National childhood growth study (NCGS) in North America


- Q. Which factors influenced better response to GH therapy according to KIGS database ?
    - Younger age
    - Birth weight
    - Lower peak GH value on GH stimulation
    - Bodyweight
    - GH dose
    - More difference between height of child and MPH
    - All this predicts response to therapy in the first year of therapy


- Q. Is there any evidence of giving a higher dose during puberty improves final height ?
    - Yes
    - In one study, GH was at the dose of 70 ug/kg was compared to standard dose in puberty and children given higher dose had 3.6 cm gain in final adult height
    - Children not achieving expected GV at puberty may benefit with higher dose up to 100 ug/kg during puberty


- Q. What happens when GH therapy is not initiated until puberty ?
    - In such cases response to GH in any case may not be very good because epiphysis would have started to close


- Q. Does giving GnRH agonist therapy to halt puberty along with GH in children diagnosed with GH deficiency during puberty any helpful ?
    - Some studies have shown benefit of this approach
    - However, the benefit must be judged against the potential risks
    - The risks include
    - Less bone accrual during puberty
    - Psychological issues with delayed puberty


- Q. Will adding aromatase inhibitor to GH therapy in boys be helpful ?
    - Yes
    - One study has shown that adding anastoazole to GH therapy in boys with GH deficiency helped the final adult height
    - However, safety of this approach may have issues


- Q. Does GH therapy in childhood improve peak bone mass in adulthood ?
    - Yes
    - Hence continuing GH therapy in transition to adulthood may help in improving the peak bone mass


- **CONTRAINDICATIONS**


- Q. Can GH be used in presence of retinopathy ?
    - Proliferative or severe NPDR – contraindications


- Q. What about active malignancy ?
    - Malignancy
    - Ongoing active malignancy is a contraindication
    - If malignancy is treated it is not a contraindication


- Q. Does GH improve outcomes in critically ill patients ?
    - No it in fact, increases mortality
    - So it is contraindicated


- Q. What about Prader Willi?
    - It is per se not a contraindication for Prader Willi
    - It is contraindicated in PWS  in the following cases
        - Severe obesity
        - Upper respiratory tract obstruction
        - Untreated sleep apnea
        - Lung infection


- **Adverse effects  **


- Q. Which is the commonest side effect of GH therapy ?
    - It is headache


- Q. Enlist some common side effects in children ?
    - Headache
    - Idiopathic intracranial tension
    - Increase intraocular pressure
    - Worsening of scoliosis
    - Puberty gynecomastia
    - Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
    - Growth of nevi


- Q. How does GH affect cortisol metabolism ?
    - GH inhibits conversion of cortisone to cortisol by blocking 11 beta HSD1


- Q. When does IIH occur after starting treatment ?
    - Generally within 8 weeks after starting therapy
    - It generally resolves on stopping the medications


- Q. Which ADR are common in adults but rare in children ?
    - Arthralgia
    - Edema
    - Carpal tunnel syndrome


- Q. Does GH increase blood sugar ?
    - Yes
    - However incidence of new-onset diabetes and/OR IGT is rare


- Q. Does GH therapy increase the risk of cancer ?
    - No


- Q. Does it lead to secondary malignancy in children who are cancer survivors ?
    - No


- Q. Which benign cancer is probably increased in certain kids ?
    - Meningioma in kids with brain tumors treated with radiotherapy


- Q. What is SAGhe study ?
    - Study done in Europe done to find side effects of GH therapy
    - Found slightly high CV mortality in long term with children treated with GH
    - However, because of flaws in the study, it has been a bit discredited


- Q. Does it cause Creutzfeldt Jacob disease ?
    - Older prerpration from Pituitary extract had this risk
    - Not newer preparations


- **Duration of therapy  **


- Q. Till when should treatment for GH supplementation be continued ?
    - It should be continued till  final height is achieved defined by :
    - Growth velocity <1 cm /year (uptodate say 2-2.5 cm / year)
    - Fusion of long bone of epiphysis has taken place


- **Once weekly GH **


- Q. How much GV is typically seen with both once weekly and daily injection?
    - About 11 cm /year in the first year


- Q. What is the dose of once-weekly Eutropin?
    - 0.5 mg/kg/week


- Q. When is IGF1 measured after GH injection
    - The timing of IGF1 measurement actually does not matter, however, measure if 12 hours after the last dose and day 4 of once-weekly injection according to Khadilkar’s study


- #Updates  **Notes from Endosessions **


- #Clinicalpearl
    - IGF1 based approach is actually new in pediatrics while it is a standard in adult endocrine
    - In adult endocrine – GH therapy – IGF1 is target to the normal range
    - While in children , traditionally, growth is used as a parameter
    - IGF1 correlates with the growth in children too, and hence IGF1 based approach may be a good idea for children as well


- Q. Who grows more with the same IGF1 on GH therapy – ISS or GH deficient?
    - GH deficient patients have a better response to GH despite having the same IGF1 compared to ISS patients
    - ISS patients have some degree of GH and IGF1 insensitivity
