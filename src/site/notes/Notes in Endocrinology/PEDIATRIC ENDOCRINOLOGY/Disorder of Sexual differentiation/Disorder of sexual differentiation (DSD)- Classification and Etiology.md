- Q. What is DSD ?
    - Disorder of Sexual differentiation
- Q. What features are considered atypical genitalia at birth ?
    - Male type
        - Bilateral absent testis
        - Micropenis
        - Perineal hypospadias
        - Bifid scrotum
    - Female type
        - Palpable gonads in labioscrotal folds
        - Clitoromegaly
        - Posterior labial fusion
- Q. Which tests are sent immediately when you have a child with Atypical genitalia ?
    - Karyotype with FISH for SRY
        - 17 OHP
        - Cortisol
        - Electrolytes
        - Pelvic abdominal USG
- **Classifications of DSD**
- Q. What are the three types of DSD ?
    - XY DSD
    - XX DSD
    - Sex chromosome DSD
- Q. What is another classification of DSD ?
    - Malformative DSD – Abnormal morphogenesis of urogenital primordia
    - Dysgenetic DSD- Abnormal gonadal differentiation
    - Non Dysgenetic DSD- Abnormal sex hormone steroidogenesis
- Q. What are causes of Malformative DSD ?
    - Abnormal development of external genitalia
    - Isolated micropenis
    - Isolated hypospadias
    - Abnormal development of internal genitalia
    - MRKH
    - Absent vas deferens – cystic fibrosis
- Q. What are causes of Dysgenetic DSD ?
    - Complete gonadal dysgenesis
    - Partial gonadal dysgenesis
    - Mild gonadal dysgenesis
    - Asymmetric gonadal differentiation – ovotesticular DSD
- Q. What are causes of complete gonadal dysgenesis ?
    - Turner syndrome
    - 46 XX gonadal dysgenesis
    - WNT4 and RSPO1
    - 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis
    - Mutation in transcription factors – WT1, SRY SOX9, SF1, DHH, ATRX
    - Chromosomal abnormalities- Yp deletion, 9q deletion (DMRT1), XP duplication
- Q. What are causes of partial gonadal dysgenesis ?
    - Same causes which cause complete GD can cause partial GD also
    - Environmental factors- Endocrine disruptors
    - Mosaic Turner
- Q. What are causes of mild gonadal dysgenesis ?
    - 46 XX male – transfer of SRY on X chromosome
    - Klienfelter’s syndrome
- Q. What are causes of ovotesticular DSD ?
    - Mosaic sex chromosomes
    - 46XY/45 X
    - 46XY/46 XX
- Q What are causes of Non dysgenetic DSD ?
    - 46 XY
        - Abnormal testosterone biosynthesis pathway defect
        - Androgen receptor defect- Androgen insensitivity syndromes
        - Abnormality in AMH production or action- Persistent Mullerian Duct syndrome
    - 46 XX
        - Virilizing CAH
        - Placental aromatase defect
        - Maternal virilization
        - Iatrogenic Androgen exposure
- Q. Which are the Virilizing CAH in 46 XX ?
    - 21 hydroxylase
    - 3 beta HSD
    - 11 beta-hydroxylase
    - P450 oxidoreductase
- Q. What are the causes of 46 XX DSD ?
    - Malformative DSD- MRKH
    - Dysgenetic DSD
        - Turner syndrome / Mosaic Turner
        - 46 XX male – SRY translocation to X
        - Complete gonadal dysgenesis – WNT4, RSPO1 defect
        - Ovotesticular DSD
    - Non dysgenetic DSD
        - CAH
            - 21 hydroxylase
