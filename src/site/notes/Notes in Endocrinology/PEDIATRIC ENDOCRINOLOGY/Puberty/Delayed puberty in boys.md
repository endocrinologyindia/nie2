- Q. What is the typical pubertal development in [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE HYPOGONADISM/Klinefelter syndrome\|Klinefelter syndrome]]?
    - They have stalled puberty (Arrested puberty)
    - Pubertal development takes place generally at first
    - They have pubic hair development
    - At around testicular volume of 8-10 ml- the puberty does not progress further – testis are small and sotty
    - They also start having gynecomastia

    - More in boys


- Q. How will you differentiate [[Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP)\|Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP)]] from [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE HYPOGONADISM/Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in boys\|Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in boys]]? 
    - Step 1: History and Examination 
        - Points towards CDGP
            - 1.	Family history of CDGP
                - o	Age of menarche of Mother- >15 years is delayed (After 10th grade)
                - o	Continued growth of father after completing school
                - o	Growth spurt after 11th grade in father
                - o	Started shaving after 11th grade
        - Points towards IHH
            - 1.	Anosmia
            - 2.	 Testicular volume 1-2 ml with a bone age of >12 years
            - 3.	Micropenis at birth
            - 4.	Cryptorchidism at birth
            - 5.	Midline defect
            - 6.	Cleft lip / cleft palate
    - Step 2: Basic Investigations 
        - Tests to order
            - 1.	Total [[Testosterone\|Testosterone]]
            - 2.	LH
            - 3.	FSH
            - 4.	Bone age 
            - 5.	[[DHEAS\|DHEAS]] 
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FSHJzE9QsfN.png?alt=media&token=7b8433db-00fe-4cd7-94a6-ee244a7d1bb1)
    - Step 3- Advanced Tests and Stimulation tests
        - 1.	Inhibin B
        - 2.	GnRH Agonist testing
        - 3.	[[HCG stimulation test\|HCG stimulation test]]
            - [[Inhibin B\|Inhibin B]]
                - •	Value < 35 pg/ml- IHH for sure
                - •	35-100 pg/ml- Either way-more in favor of CDGP 
                - •	>100 pg/ml- CDGP for Sure 
    - 2.	[[GnRH agonist testing\|GnRH agonist testing]]
        - LUPEROLIDE PROTOCOL (Lakhani protocol developed from Street et al.)
            - 1.	Baseline LH
            - 2.	Inj LUPRIDE 1 mg vial (0.5ml) in Insulin – 100 IU syringe order
                - a.	0.25 ml (0.5 mg) – 25 units in Insulin syringe
                - b.	Inject Subcutaneously
            - 3.	Repeat LH after 2 hr and 4 hr
                - Interpretation
                    - 1.	Peak LH > 6.1 - Suggestive of CDGP
                    - 2.	Peak LH <2.8 IHH
                    - 3.	2.8-6.1- either way – Favour CDGP
        - TRIPTORELIN PROTOCOL 
            - 1.	 Baseline LH 
            - 2.	Inj DECAPEPTYL (Triptorelin) 1 ml subcutaneous (100 ug)- 100 IU in insulin syringe
            - 3.	Check LH and FSH after 2 hrs and 4 hrs
            - 4.	If Peak LH >5 – suggestive of CDGP
                - a.	Dergos et al. say 14 IU/l is more discriminatory 
        - [[HCG stimulation test\|HCG stimulation test]]
            - 1.	Baseline testosterone
            - 2.	In HCG (FERTIGYN), 1500 IU IM on alternate days for 3 days
            - 3.	Day 7 – Repeat testosterone
                - a.	>230 ng/dl – CDGP
        - ALTERNATE SINGLE DOSE HCG PROTOCOL (DERGOS et al.) 
        - 1.	Baseline Testosterone
        - 2.	Inj HCG (FERTIGYN) – 5000 IU im
        - 3.	Repeat testosterone after 72 hrs
            - a.	Tetosterone >260 ng/dl- CDGP
            - b.	<86 ng/dl- IHH
        - Step 4- Follow Up
            - 1.	Inj TESTOVIRON 50 mg monthly for 3 months
            - 2.	Recheck Testosterone 1 month after the last injection
                - a.	Testosterone > 300 ng/ml- Suggestive of CDGP
                - b.	<300 ng/ml- IHH

- Q. Which is more important for assessment in a child with delayed puberty- FSH or LH?
    - FSH- more important for a child with delayed puberty
    - LH-more important for a child with precocious puberty

    - inj Testosterone (Testoviron)-  100 mg – monthly injection – 3 times
    - After the third injection- they generally have a push of puberty
    - If no push- then wait for a few months and give a second course

    - It could be testis which is inguinal. Suggests Undescended testis.


- Q. What is [[cryptorchidism\|cryptorchidism]] ?
    - It is testis that is not present in the scrotum by 4 months of age. It could be either absent testis or undescended testis.


- Q. What is [[anorchia \|anorchia ]]?
    - 46 XY DSD with both testis absent at birth


- Q. How will you interpret the past history of undescended testis in a  child presenting with delayed puberty at 15 years? What are the clinical conditions associated with bilateral [[cryptorchidism\|cryptorchidism]]?
    - > Genetic disorders are more common in children with bilateral cryptorchidism than those without it
    - Hypogonadism and Cryptorchidism
        - 46 XY DSD- Ovotesticular syndrome, mixed gonadal dysgenesis – esp if associated with hypospadias

        - Defects in testosterone action- Androgen insensitivity syndrome 
        - Bilateral cryptorchidism is more associated with other conditions than unilateral


- Q. What is the most common location for undescended testis?
    - Just outside the external ring


- Q. By what age do undescended testis generally descend?
    - Generally, by 6 months of age
    - If they don’t descend by that time- unlikely to descend further


- Q. What pubertal development sign in boys is considered equivalent to menarche?
    - Presence of nocturnal sperm emissions or sperm in urine


- Q. What time before the development of pubic hair does testis tend to develop?
    - About 6 months
    - Testis development starts about 6 months before pubic hair development


- Q. How will you ask for a history of Delayed puberty in parents?
    - Mother- the onset of menses after 15 years of age
    - Father
    - Growth spurt after 16 years of age
    - Continued to grow in height after graduating from school
    - When did they start to shave


- Q. What age do facial hair develop in children?
    - About 2.5 years after growth of testis or about 2 years after growth of pubic hair
    - Generally, boys develop facial hair at about 15 years of age
    - However, facial hair is not a reliable sign because it depends on ethnicity


- Q. Should DSD be considered in a case of bilateral [[cryptorchidism\|cryptorchidism]]?
    - Yes


- Q. What will you suspect if the patient has tall stature and Hypogonadism?

- Q. What other physical examination findings would you look for?
    - Upper segment: Lower segment ratio – would suggest eunuchoid proportion going in favor of Kleinfelter’s
    - Whether testis appears atrophic or not


- Q. What is Tanner Stage 3 pubic hair?
    - Hair is dark, coarse, and curly
    - Extends to the mid pubis


- Q. What is DD of Clinodactyly with Hypogonadism?
    - [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE HYPOGONADISM/Klinefelter syndrome\|Klinefelter syndrome]]
