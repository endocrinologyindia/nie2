- Q. Define Turner syndrome 
     - Gravholt et al. define Turner syndrome as "Turner syndrome is a rare condition in women that is associated with either complete or partial loss of one X chromosome, often in mosaic karyotypes ^[Gravholt, C.H., Viuff, M.H., Brun, S. __et al.__ Turner syndrome: mechanisms and management. __Nat Rev Endocrinol__ **15, **601–614 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-019-0224-4]


- Q. What is the result of mitotic division and meiotic division? 
    - Mitosis leads to the development of two daughter cells which are identical to the parent cell and are diploid
    - Meiosis goes to two rounds of division to produce four daughter cells which are haploid. There is a cross over and recombination of genetic information leading to the development of daughter cells which are different from the parent cells


- Q. What are the phases of mitosis? 
    - PMAT- Prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase 


- Q. What are the two rounds in Meiosis? 
    - The first round is reduction division, and the second round keeps the same number as in mitosis 


- Q. At what phase do the chromosome defects mainly occur? 
    - They mainly occur in the anaphase


- Q What is non-disjunction? 
    - Failure of sister chromatids to separate 


- Q. Broadly, what are the types of chromosomal abnormalities? 
    - Chromosomal abnormalities
    - Abnormality in number  - aneuploidy or polyploidy
    - Abnormality in structure – Deletion, duplication, inversion, etc 


- Q. What is aneuploidy? 
    - Aneuploidy means there is one chromosome extra compared to usual or one chromosome less
    - Trisomy – means extra chromosome, monosomy means one less chromosome 


- Q. What is polyploidy? 
    - Polyploidy is an incremental number of chromosomes in sets – instead of 2 pairs – we have four pairs of chromosome


- Q. What are the causes of aneuploidy? 
    - Meiotic non-disjunction- can occur in both phases of meiosis
    - Mitotic non-disjunction – occurs in anaphase of mitosis
    - Chromosomal translocations 


- Q. What are collecting system abnormalities? 
    - Abnormalities in the ureter- 2 ureters joining bladder, etc 


- Q. What is hypertelorism? 
    - Increase the distance between the eyes


- **Pathogenesis of Turner syndrome**


- Q. What is the reason behind the chromosomal abnormality of Turner’s? 
    - Genetics: Chromosomal Origins
    - Most commonly due to error(s) of recombination and segregation occurring during meiotic divisions
    - Less commonly due to non-disjunction in early embryonic mitotic cell divisions 
        - (e.g., 45,X/47,XXX; 45,X/46,XX; 45,X/46,XY)
    - Molecular triggers are poorly understood
    - Not preferentially linked to maternal meiotic errors or age and may be more commonly associated with paternal meiotic errors

    - More severe and critical AS presents in infancy itself and have heart failure 


- Q. Is antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis prevention recommended in patients with bicuspid aortic valve? 
    - No
    - “Although the patient with bicuspid aortic valve is at risk for endocarditis, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for the isolated bicuspid aortic valve.”


- Q. What are the Clinical features of Coarctation of the aorta (COA)? 
    - Infants with COA- if associated with PDA – asymptomatic if PDA is closed – heart failure
    - Children- often asymptomatic
    - Adults

    - Claudication of extremities 
    - Increase the risk of intracranial aneurysm 


- Q. What are two classical clinical signs of COA? 
    - Lower limb BP < upper limb BP

- Q. How does the location of COA determine physical examination findings? 
    - If the origin of the left subclavian is proximal to the CO   - then pulse and pressure in Upper limb >> Lower limb
    - If the origin of the left subclavian is beyond the COA- then the left subclavian pulse and BP will be like the lower limb and will be less than the pulse and BP in the right upper limb
    - If the origin of both the right and left subclavian is distal to the COA- then all four limbs will have an equal pulse and BP 


- Q. What is a cardiac examination finding? 
    - Most cases normal, at least in the precordium 
    - May have associated bicuspid aortic valve- ejection click + ESM
    - Collateral- continuous mechanical murmur present

- Q. What is the definition of LBW in India? 
    - LBW is <2.5 kg irrespective of the gestational age 


- Q. What is the age at which children with Turner have maximum growth deficit? 
    - They have a maximum growth deficit by 14 years of age
    - This is because after this – even though the child does not have puberty- the epiphysis does not close, so the child continues to grow


- Q Is estrogen necessary only for growth in the peripubertal period? 
    - No 
    - Small amount of estrogen is produced by the prepubertal ovary that contributes to the growth of a child by the generation of IGF1
    - This is absent in a child with Turner syndrome 


- Q. What should be considered if a girl with Turner is short on Turner's specific chart also? 
    - Consider 
    - Celiac disease
    - Hypothyroidism
    - GH deficiency –seen in 10% of girls with Turner syndrome 


- Q. Why do girls with Turner have lymphedema? 
    - Due to maldevelopment of lymphatics due to haploinsufficiency of X chromosome. 


- Q. Why do they have CoA and bicuspid aortic valves? 
    - Maldevelopment of lymphatics of the Jugular chain  leads to cystic hygroma- may compress on the growing cardiac structures   
    - Haploinsufficiency of X chromosome 


- Q. Why do they develop webbed necks? 
    - In the later part of gestation, jugular lymphatic channels may open up, which may cause resolution of the cystic hygroma
    - The remnant of this produces Webbed neck 


- Q. What is Telecanthus? 
    - “Telecanthus (from the Greek word "tele" (τῆλε) meaning far, and the Latin word canthus, meaning either corner of the eye, where the eyelids meet) refers to the increased distance between the medial canthi of the eyes, while the inter-pupillary distance is normal.”
    - ^[https://www.encyclo.co.uk/meaning-of-telecanthus]
    - This is also seen in Turner 


- Q. What is the prevalence of Celiac disease in South India? 
    - “The prevalence of celiac disease in southern India is not known. Anecdotal experience of physicians and gastroenterologists in southern India suggests that it is very infrequent in southern India.”
    - ^[Ramakrishna BS. Celiac disease: can we avert the impending epidemic in India?. The Indian journal of medical research. 2011 Jan;133(1):5.]


- Q. What are points to take in history for a child with celiac disease?
    - Abdominal pain
    - Nausea and Vomiting
    - Diarrhea
    - Steatorrhea
    - Anorexia
    - Not gaining weight
