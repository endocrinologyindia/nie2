- Q. What type of hypoglycemia is seen with NICTH?
    - Fasting hypoglycemia
- Q. Does the diagnosis of tumor occur first or does hypoglycemia occur first?
    - The tumor is generally diagnosed first before hypoglycemia occurs
    - These are generally large tumors 
- Q. Which is the most important tumor which is associated with  NICTH (Non-Islet cell Tumor hypoglycemia) & IGF-2 related hypoglycemia?
    - Hepatocellular carcinoma
    - Adrenocortical carcinoma is a distant second
- Q. What is the most common clinical presentation of hypoglycemia in these patients?
    - These patients present with neuroglycopenia symptoms mainly
    - Loss of judgment and changes in behavior are some of the earliest signs of hypoglycemia in these patients
- Q. What is the biochemical picture in NICTH?
    - Glucose – low
    - C peptide- low
    - Insulin- low
    - Proinsulin- low
    - BOHB- low
    - **Response to glucagon – present**
- Q. What happens to the GH response in these patients?
    - The GH response is blunted because of suppression by IGF-2
- Q. Which test is a part of biochemical tests in the critical sample- give a hint of possible IGF-2-related hypoglycemia?
    - These patients have a picture of insulin-independent hypoglycemia- Insulin, C-peptide, and Proinsulin are all low
    - The key differentiating factors are two folds:
        - beta-hydroxybutyrate is low - 
            - If this was high- it would suggest a variation of normal or extreme starvation
        - GH's response is blunted 
            - the absence of raise in GH levels 
- Q. Which other electrolyte imbalance is seen in these patients?
    - Hypokalemia is often seen 
- Q. Why do some of these patients develop postprandial hyperglycemia?
    - This is because IGF-2 suppresses the pancreatic beta-cell function 
    - Hence some of these patients may have fasting hypoglycemia but postmeal hyperglycemia
- Q. Summarize the physiology of IGF-2
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FXeE9E866ws.png?alt=media&token=e99b5b95-2b7d-4691-8ff0-a541e761e234)

- Q. What is the management of NICTH?
    - Removal of the tumor
    - Glucocorticoids – reduce IGF-2
- Q. What are the conditions in which hypoglycemia and Acromegaloid features coexist?
    - 1. IGF-2 related hypoglycemia
    - 2. MEN1 syndrome
- Q. What is "Rhinophyma"? This is a feature of which possible endocrine condition?
    - Rhinophyma is a condition characterized by the thickening of the skin of the nose, resulting in a bulbous, red appearance
    - This may be seen in  Acromegaly 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2Fsg1ldZpPUT.png?alt=media&token=f7ab2de1-4df7-4505-b775-2e4e2efaba12)
- Q. What are the conditions that lead to "pseudohypoglycemia"?
    - In patients with Leukemia or Polycythemia- may have pseudohypoglyemia
    - This is because of the increased RBC consumption the glucose leading to low glucose reading in the lab 
- Q. Within what period in a 72-hour fast test do patients with  Insulinoma manifest the features of hypoglycemia?
    - Hypoglycemia is manifested within 24-36 hours of a 72-hour-fast test in patients with  Insulinoma 
- Q. What is a good clinical way of judging hypoglycemia symptoms during a 72-hour fast test?
    - Asking the patient to perform serial 7 subtraction test regularly is a good way of assessing for developing hypoglycemia
- Q. What happens to IGF-2 levels in  NICTH (Non-Islet cell Tumor hypoglycemia) & IGF-2-related hypoglycemia  ?
    - IGF-2 levels may be elevated or normal
    - If they are elevated - it confirms the diagnosis
    - but normal value - may not rule it out
- Q. Which other test is useful in this situation?
    - The molar ratio of IGF-2:IGF-1 is useful
    - Ratio 10:1 is diagnostic of this condition
        - Upto 3:1 ratio is normal
- Q. In which other condition is the IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio significantly elevated?
    - Sepsis
    - Severe cachexia
- Q. What happens to the IGFBP levels?
    - IGFBP1 and IGFBP2 are elevated
    - IGFBP3 is reduced 
- Q. Summarize the impact of IGF-2 on liver products.
    - Reduced glucose
    - Reduced IGF-1
    - Reduced ALS (acid labile subunit)
    - Reduced IGFBP3
    - Increased IGFBP2
- Q. Which other IGF-2-like component can be measured if IGF-2 is normal?
    - Pro-IGF-2 can be measured
    - There is an assay developed for the same
- Q. Can non-islet cell tumors produce some other components which can cause hypoglycemia?
    - Yes
    - Rare cases of IGF-1 and Insulin-producing tumors have been reported
- Q. Summarize the biochemical diagnosis of  NICTH (Non-Islet cell Tumor hypoglycemia) & IGF-2 related hypoglycemia  
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F12dYkhrKd7.map.jpg?alt=media&token=24fbbcb2-b2fe-46a8-80df-e3a3355f96b0)
- Q. Which organ produces  IGF-2  in normal circumstances?
    - It is produced by the liver
- Q. What is the timing of hypoglycemia seen in  NICTH (Non-Islet cell Tumor hypoglycemia) & IGF-2 related hypoglycemia?
    - It is mainly fasting hypoglycemia 
- Q. What is the difference in IGF-2-related complexes in normal patients versus those having  NICTH (Non-Islet cell Tumor hypoglycemia) & IGF-2-related hypoglycemia?
    - In Normal people 80% of the IGF2 is in form of a complex of IGF-2-IGFBP3-ALS. This is a 150 kDa ternary complex
    - In  NICTH (Non-Islet cell Tumor hypoglycemia) & IGF-2 related hypoglycemia  - 80% of the complex is in form of IGF-2 with IGFBP3. This is a smaller 50 KDA binary complex
        - This is formed because of suppression of ALS production by IGF-2 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FYQ7sD9ejue.png?alt=media&token=ffde33d6-0dc3-4f32-ac81-1daecc5ae449)
- Q. Can you tell me the sequence of conversion from Prepro IGF2 complex to IGF2?
    - See the picture below 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FqKPZXTULoU.png?alt=media&token=8066682f-90bc-4b97-9032-57b4459e7f37)
- Q. Of the above, which component primarily causes hypoglycemia?
    - The interaction of the Big IGF2 (1-87) with the insulin receptor is mainly responsible for the hypoglycemia seen in this condition 
- Q. Which other endocrine disorder is seen because of  IGF-2?
    - Big IGF-2 produces  Hepatitis-C associated osteosclerosis 
- Q. Do patients with  Hepatitis-C associated osteosclerosis also have hypoglycemia?
    - Interestingly, no
    - Patients with this condition do not have hypoglycemia while patients with IGF-2-related hypoglycemia do not have osteosclerosis! 
    - This is because both are caused by a distinct isoform of Big-IGF2
- Q. What is the treatment for this condition?
    - Treatment is directed towards two things:
        - 1. Treatment of the underlying tumor
            - Resection of the underlying tumor often resolves the symptoms
            - In some cases where the tumor may not be completely resectable, debulking is also helpful
        - 2. Management of hypoglycemia 
            - Glucocorticoids are the first line of therapy geared towards correcting hypoglycemia in this condition and are found to be very useful
            - Interestingly, growth hormone therapy is the second line of therapy in this condition (despite the theoretical risk of tumor progression)
            - It is also interesting to note that Somatostatin analogs are NOT useful in this condition
- Q. How does growth hormone help in this condition?
    - Growth hormone increases the production of IGFBP3 and ALS leading to increase binding of the Free IGF2 and its removal from the circulation 
- Q. Can you give some landmarks in the discovery of hypoglycemia and IGF2-related disease?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FhNmR9C7xXp.png?alt=media&token=b2b17e52-9704-493f-b111-2acfa829a3c8)
- Q. Who was the first person to give the concept of hypoglycemia?
    - The concept of Hypoglycemia was first understood from the work of Minkowski and von Mering who demonstrated fatality in animals after hepatectomy
    - They also demonstrated that the pancreas was the source of antidiabetic agent (insulin) that later led to the discovery of insulin 
- Q. How was hypoglycemia discovered in humans?
    - Hypoglycemia was first demonstrated in humans having Addison's disease by Porges, in patients operated from the pituitary tumor by Cushing, and in emaciated diabetics by Joslin
- Q. In which condition was hypoglycemia used as a form of therapy?
    - Insulin shock therapy was a form of treatment for patients with schizophrenia 
    - Typically 100-150 units of insulin were used to produce severe hypoglycemia
    - This treatment was later replaced
