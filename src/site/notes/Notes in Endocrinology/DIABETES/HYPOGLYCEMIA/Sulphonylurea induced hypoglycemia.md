- Q. How are  Sulphonylurea metabolised?
    - They are metabolised via the liver and have active metabolites excreted via the kidney
    - hence both liver dysfunction and renal dysfunction can cause  Sulphonylurea induced hypoglycemia 
    - They are also protein bound and hence have a longer half-life
- Q. Which are the most common neuroglycopenic symptoms of hypoglycemia?
    - Confusion
    - Personality change
- Q. Which are the most common autonomic symptoms of hypoglycemia?
    - Diaphoresis
    - Tremors
- Q. What kind of hypoglycemia is caused by  Sulphonylurea?
    -  insulin-dependent hypoglycemia 
    - Elevated insulin and c-peptide levels in presence of hypoglycemia is a critical sample
- Q. How is hypoglycemia acutely corrected with  IV Dextrose?
    - Adults- 1-2ml/kg (generally 25 gram- 50ml) of 50% dextrose
    - Children - 2-4 ml/kg of 25% dextrose
    - Infant- 5-10 ml/kg of 10% dextrose 
    - Once the acute correction is given - continuous glucose infusion is continued 
- Q. Which other vitamin must be given with dextrose?
    - If  Thiamine   deficiency is suspected- give 100 mg IV of thiamine along with the glucose
    - This is to prevent  Wernicke's encephalopathy 
- Q. Can glucagon be given in this setting?
    - Yes
    - But this is not a substitute for  IV Dextrose 
- Q. What is done in case of a symptomatic intentional overdose of  Sulphonylurea?
    - this must be treated with both  IV Dextrose  and  Octreotide 
    - IV dextrose- though important must not be used alone
    - this is because IV dextrose can lead to hyperglycemia â†’ which stimulates the release of insulin further 
    - Hence  Octreotide  must be given along with IV dextrose
    -  Octreotide  blocks the further release of insulin 
    - A continuous  IV Dextrose  infusion may also be given 
- Q. How is  Octreotide given?
    - it is given in the dose of 50-100 mcg subcutaneous or IM every 6 hours in adults. 
    - In children, it is given 1-1.5 mcg/kg every 6 hrly 
    - It can also be given as IV infusion, but subcutaneous or IM is enough in most cases
- Q. How long is  Octreotide given?
    - It is given for 24 hours
    - generally not required to repeat after the same
    - If hypoglycemia persists after 24 hours- then repeat   Octreotide 
- Q. How is IV dextrose infusion given?
    - Adults 5% dextrose - 75-100 ml/hr
    - Children- 6-9 mg/kg/min dextrose infusion 
- Q. How is a rate of infusion calculated based on mg/kg/min?
    - Rate of Infusion = (dose required in mg/kg/min x 6 x weight) / Percent dextrose in solution 
    - for example 10 kg child, needing 8 mg/kg/min infusion of 10% dextrose- give 48 ml/hr based on the above calculation 
- Q. Apart from  Octreotide which other medication can be used?
    -  Diazoxide 
    - But Octreotide is better than  Diazoxide 
- Q. Is  Octreotide also given during a single episode of level 2 or level 3 Sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycemia?
    - No 
    -  Octreotide  is not required for a single episode of  Sulphonylurea induced hypoglycemia 
    - It is to be given only when there is level 3 hypoglycemia, intentional overdose, or multiple episodes of level 2 hypoglycemia
    - In a single episode- observe the patient for 24 hours- if there is a second episode then give  Octreotide  else discharge after 24 hours of observation 
    - IV dextrose may be given as appropriate and carbohydrate-rich meal may be given
