- Q. What are the two types of autoimmune  Hypoglycemia?
    - 1.  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease) 
        - Also called Hirata's disease
    - 2. Type B  Insulin resistance 
        - Antibody against the insulin receptor
- Q. What are the definition and diagnostic criteria for  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)?
    - All of the following criteria must be present
        - (I)  hyperinsulinemic  Hypoglycemia  ; 
        - (II) elevated  Insulin autoantibody  (IAA) titers; 
        - (III) no prior exposure to exogenous  insulin ; 
        - (IV) no pathological abnormalities of the pancreatic islets.
    - Recently however many cases have been observed in which the patient has had exposure to insulin. Hence point III is not considered redundant 
- Q. Which other autoimmune disease is  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)  most closely linked with?
    -  Graves' disease 
    - It could be because of 
        - 1. Common autoimmune source
        - 2. Induced by the use of  antithyroid drugs 
- Q.  Which commonly used drugs have been linked with  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)?
    - 1.  antithyroid drugs  - Carbimazole, Methimazole
    - 2. Alpha lipoic acid
    - 3. Clopidogrel
    - 4. Steroids
    - 5. Diclofenac
    - 6. Imipenem
    - 7. Isoniazid
    - 8. Pantoprazole
    - 9. Omeprazole 
- Of these  methimazole  and  alpha lipoic acid  have the strongest link to the disease

- Q. Which HLA has a strong link with the development of  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)?
    - HLA DRB1*0406
    - This is more common in Asians hence the disease is more common in Asians
- Q. How many weeks after starting the offending medication does the disease develop?
    - It typically develops 4-6 weeks after starting the offending medication
- Q. Apart from medications, which other triggers have been identified?
    - 1. Viral infections
    - 2. Hematological diseases 
- Q. Which viruses are known to be triggers?
    - 1. Hepatitis C
    - 2. Measles
    - 3. Mumps
    - 4. Coxsackie B
    - 5. Varicella zoster
    - 6. Rubella 
- Q. Which hematological disorders have been linked?
    - Multiple myeloma
    - Monoclonal gammopathy
- Q. What type of hypersensitivity is  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)?
    - it is Type VII hypersensitivity 
    - It is a novel category of hypersensitivity
- Q.  Which is the key pathogenic antibody causing this disease?
    - Insulin autoantibody (IAA)
    - This is an IgG antibody 
- Q. Does the mere presence of IAA produce the disease?
    - No
    - Low titers of the antibody in circulation do not produce the disease
- Q.  What are the clinical phases of  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)?
    - Initially, the antibodies bind to the insulin leading to a transient reduction in insulin levels and hence transient postprandial hyperglycemia
    - After this, the insulin dissociates from the antibody irrespective of the glucose levels leading to the development of  Hypoglycemia  
- Q. How does one distinguish between  Insulinoma and  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)?
    - 1. Clinically
        - Insulin autoimmune syndrome produces mainly post-prandial  Hypoglycemia. It can also produce fasting and exercise-induced  Hypoglycemia 
        - Insulinoma- mainly produces fasting  Hypoglycemia 
    - 2. Insulin: C-peptide ratio
        - Convert insulin to pmol/l
        - Conver C-peptide to pmol/l using units lab
        - Insulin: C-peptide ratio calculated
            - Less than 1 → suggestive of Insulinoma
            - More than 1 → suggestive of  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)

- Q. Why does the insulin: C-peptide ratio show what it shows?
    - Insulin in circulation has a short half-life compared to C-peptide
    - In  Insulinoma there is a release of C-peptide and insulin both in large quantities released in equal concentration. C-peptide having a higher half-life is often found more easily in circulation 
    - In  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease)  the  C-peptide is released at its rate while the insulin is stuck to the antibody. Hence in these cases, insulin levels tend to be disproportionately more than  C-peptide 
- Q. Name two conditions in which insulin levels tend to be disproportionate compared to C-peptide levels.
    -  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease) 
    - Exogenous insulin use 
- Q. What is the problem with the measurement of insulin autoantibodies?
    - Here only the IgG subclass of antibody is detected in the commercial assay
    - Hence we may have false negative values
- Q. What should be done in case of false negative Insulin autoantibodies with high suspicion of the disease?
    - Precipitation of the serum with PEG is done followed by recovery of the insulin from the supernatant 
    - In patients with  Insulin autoimmune syndrome (Hirata's disease) 
        - After PEG precipitation- the bound insulin levels are higher than free insulin levels
        - In normal people- free insulin is higher than bound insulin
- Q. What are the clinical features of patients having antibodies to insulin receptors?
    - Here there is initially Hyperglycemia along with extreme insulin resistance
    - the antibodies may be both blocking and stimulating
    - in case blocking antibodies remain- they mainly lead to hyperglycemia and Insulin resistance
    - In case of stimulating antibody present- they start developing hypoglycemia
- Q. Which tumors are associated with these insulin autoimmune syndromes?
    - Antibody against insulin seen in  multiple myeloma 
    - Antibody against insulin receptor sen in  Hodgkin lymphoma 
- Q. What is the treatment for this condition?
    - Most cases are self-resolving 
    - It is because if the antigen is withdrawn- the antibody slowly withdraws over a while 
    - Generally within 3-6 months
- Q. What are the other treatment options?
    - Small frequent meals with low carbohydrate content
    - Acarbose
    - Glucocorticoids 
    - Diazoxide
    - Octreotide
    - Partial pancreatectomy
    - Plasmapheresis
    - Other immunosuppressants
        - Azathioprine
        - Cyclophosphamide
        - Mycophenolate
        - Rituximab
