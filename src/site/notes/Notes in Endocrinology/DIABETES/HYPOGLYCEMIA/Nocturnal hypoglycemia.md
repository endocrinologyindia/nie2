- Q. What percentage of hypoglycemia observed in the  DCCT trial was nocturnal?
    - 43%
- Q. What are the various types of brain waves?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FKuJ3jGhufD.png?alt=media&token=01d4946b-2086-42ba-a7fc-7056d6b1a841)
- Q. What happens to the brain waves during hypoglycemia in an awake state?
    - there is a reduction in alpha waves but an increase in theta and delta waves
- Q. What happens in hypoglycemia during sleep?
    - In children- there are no changes in brain waves observed
    - In adults- when glucose is <45 mg/dl
        - There is a reduction of alpha waves 
        - Prominent changes in theta waves 
- Q. Does the brain have the same sensitivity to hypoglycemia during sleep, as when they are awake?
    - yes
    - The threshold for glucose values when brain waves changes occur suggests there is the same sensitivity for brain changes during sleep as it is during an awake state
    - Hence brain retains inability to respond to hypoglycemia in sleep, atleast in adults
- Q. But is the counter-regulatory response during sleep the same as during the awake state?
    - No
    - The counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia is less profound during sleep than in an awake state
    - The glucagon response is preserved in non-diabetics, but in certain patients with diabetes it is blunted (see below)
    - The third line of defense, the sympathoadrenal response is reduced in people. 
- Q. Does the stage of the sleep also determine the response?
    - Yes
    - The counter-regulatory response is also dependent on the stage of the sleep cycle when hypoglycemia occurs.
- Q. What is the clinical consequence on sleep quality in patients having nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - Adults with recurrent nocturnal hypoglycemia have poor sleep quality 
- Q. What percentage of nocturnal hypoglycemia are asymptomatic?
    - A large proportion are asymptomatic
        - 50% of adults and 78% of children are asymptomatic
        - It may even be prolonged and last for as much as 6 hours 
- Q. What are the changes that occur to hepatic glucose production during sleep?
    - During sleep hepatic glucose output reduces in response to reduce peripheral utilization of glucose
    - this is mainly driven by continuous basal insulin secretion
- Q. It is true that type 1 and type 2 diabetes with beta-cell failure have reduced counter-regulatory hormones also?
    - Yes
    - In type 1 diabetes and those with beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes also have blunted glucagon response
    - This per se does not produce hypoglycemia but reduces their capacity to respond to hypoglycemia in case it develops
- Q. What are the  Somogyi effect and the  Dawn phenomenon?
	- ![Patient on Insulin.png](/img/user/attachments/Patient%20on%20Insulin.png)
- Q. Does the  Somogyi effect exist in reality?
    - Experimental evidence does show the existence of the  Somogyi effect 
    - However, even during the period of  NPH  insulin use, it was rare
    - The use of modern basal insulin nearly makes the phenomenon non-existent 
- Q. What is a good reliable test for predicting the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - The bedtime glucose value is a strong predictor of nocturnal hypoglycemia
    - Bedtime glucose associated with nocturnal hypoglycemia 
        - <108 mg/dl in adults with type 1 diabetes 
        - <130 mg/dl in children with type 1 diabetes
    - #Pearl:
        - Bedtime glucose is a good predictor of hypoglycemia earlier in the night
        - Fasting glucose a good predictor of early morning hypoglycemia
            - FBS <99 mg/dl for a patient on basal-bolus insulin suggests early morning hypoglycemia may have occurred 
- Q. Which SMBG is useful for the diagnosis of nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - 3 am glucose reading
    - Though this is impractical
    - Hence  CGM  is useful for the diagnosis of nocturnal hypoglycemia 
- Q. Broadly, what are the symptoms of nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - Symptoms may be subtle and variable
        - Poor sleep quality
        - Vivid dreams and nightmares
        - Morning headache
        - Chronic fatigue
        - Mood changes
        - Night sweats and Wet bedsheets and bedclothes (because of sweat)
        - Enuresis (in children)
        - Restless behavior during sleep 
- Q. Can it lead to mortality?
    - Yes
    - It can potentially trigger arrhythmia
    - The "Dead-in-the-bed" syndrome
    - Use of alcohol also contributes to the same in patients with diabetes

- Q. Can convulsions occur due to nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - Yes
- Q. What are the long terms issues with nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - Cognitive impairment
    -  hypoglycemia unawareness 
- Q. Can bedtime snacks reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - Yes
    - However, short-acting carbohydrates are not ideal for this purpose- they still make the patient vulnerable to hypoglycemia early in the morning
    - Uncooked cornstarch is ideal for such an action
    - Adding acarbose before dinner is also a useful way of preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes
- Q. What are the other ways of preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - 1. Using modern long-acting basal insulin analogs
        - Glargine U300
        - Insulin degludec
    - 2. Using rapidly acting insulin analogs before dinner
    - 3. Use of sensor-augmented insulin pumps
- Q. Does giving glargine U100 in the morning reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia?
    - Yes
    - In some patients, this is seen 
    - This is probably because glargine U100 may not work for 24 hours in some patients- hence the effect of glargine wears off during nighttime
    - However insulin glargine U300 solves this problem
