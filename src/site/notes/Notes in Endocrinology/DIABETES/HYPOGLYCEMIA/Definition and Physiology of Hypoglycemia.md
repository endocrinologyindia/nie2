- Q. What is the definition of Hypoglycemia in diabetics?
    - All episodes of abnormally low plasma glucose with or without symptoms that expose an individual to harm
    - People with diabetes should be concerned about hypoglycemia when the self-monitored BG is <70 mg/dl (remember it is the SMBG value)
- Q. What is the current ADA definition of Hypoglycemia?
    - ADA defines hypoglycemia as plasma glucose < 70 mg/dl 
    - The ADA defines the levels of hypoglycemia as follows:
        - Level 1 Glucose <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and ≥54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L)
        - Level 2 Glucose <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L)
        - Level 3 - A severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance for treatment of hypoglycemia
- Q. Why is 70 mg/dl chosen as the lower cutoff?
    - Counterregulatory response start at this level
    - Sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia occur at this level
- Q. What is the definition of hypoglycemia in non-diabetics?
    - Hypoglycemia is defined in a non-diabetic only when Whipple’s triad is fulfilled which is
        - Low plasma glucose
        - Symptoms of hypoglycemia at the time of low plasma glucose
        - Correction of symptoms with administration of Glucose or glucagon
- Q. At what glucose level are various counter-regulatory hormones activated which counteract the hypoglycemia?
    - Glucose 80-85 mg/dl- reduces serum insulin level
    - 65-70 – an increase of glucagon
    - 60-65- an increase of epinephrine
    - 50-55- symptoms of hypoglycemia- food-seeking behaviour
        - Cortisol and GH – late responses to hypoglycemia
    - <50 mg/dl- cognitive dysfunction
- Q. How does Adrenaline increase blood glucose?
    - Via alpha 2 receptor →  suppresses insulin production
    - Via beta 2 receptor → increase gluconeogenesis by liver and kidney
    - Via Beta 3- increase lipolysis → increase FA → increase peripheral insulin resistance
- Q. Why do diabetics have an increased risk of hypoglycemia?
    - Glucose-glucagon axis is blunted  glucagon released is impaired because of the impaired connection between glucose and glucagon
    - Use of insulin  - in normal cases reduction of blood glucose reduces insulin, which is not possible if exogenous insulin is used
    - Use of other drugs which cause hypoglycemia
    - Hypoglycemia associated with autonomic failure
    - Blunted sympathoadrenal response
