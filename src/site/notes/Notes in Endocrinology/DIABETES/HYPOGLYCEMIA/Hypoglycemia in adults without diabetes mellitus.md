    - More than 2 fold increase in insulin in any artery territory is a positive response
    - If there is an increase in response in all arteries- suggestive of a Diffuse process of NIPHS
    - If there is increased uptake in one artery alone- s/o of  Insulinoma
- Q. Response in which artery suggests what location of an insulinoma?
    - Gastroduodenal – Head of the pancreas
    - Superior mesenteric artery- Body of pancreas
    - Splenic artery- tail of the pancreas
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FV8vuB5rRNQ.png?alt=media&token=7166d7ba-678a-4208-88f9-e69c4be83e0a)

- Q. What are the causes of Postprandial hypoglycemia?
    - NIPHS (Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome)
    - Insulin autoimmune syndrome
    - Post gastric bypass
    - Post-bariatric surgery 
    - Insulinoma
    - Hereditary fructose intolerance
    - Factitious hypoglycemia
    - Mild early type 2 diabetes
    - Early Post pancreatic transplant
    - Large amount of alcohol with simple carbs- Gin and Tonic syndrome
- Q. What is post prandial syndrome ?
    - Post-prandial syndrome was previously called reactive hypoglycemia
    - It is anxiety, perspiration, or palpitation after a meal
    - It is blood glucose <50 mg/dl on extended OGTT but symptoms not correlating with the drop in blood sugar
    - Only those patients with PPS fulfilling Whipple’s triad may be subjected to further evaluation
- Q. How is post-prandial syndrome treated?
    - With reassurance
    - Small frequent meals with high fiber content
    - Acarbose may help
- Q. What is the investigation of choice for Postprandial hypoglycemia?
    - It is a mixed meal diagnostic test
- Q. Give the protocol for the mixed meal diagnostic test  
    - Draw blood before giving a meal 
    - Then give the normal meal which the patient takes every day or the meal that specifically causes hypoglycemia (avoid using glucose or liquid meals- conflicting results)
        - Collect blood samples every 30 min for 5 hrs
        - If a patient develops symptoms then collect additional blood samples before giving carbohydrate
        - All samples labeled and sent to the lab
        - First check glucose in the lab- further tests are to be done only if glucose in the sample is <55 mg/dl
            - Additional tests are :
                - Insulin
                - C peptide
    - If Whipple’s triad is established then also test for
        - Insulin antibodies
        - SU/ Meglitinide
- Q. What is alimentary hypoglycemia?
    - It is a form of a post-prandial syndrome rather than true post-prandial hypoglycemia in patients who have undergone upper GI surgery
- Q. What is dumping syndrome?
    - This also occurs in patients who have undergone GI surgery
    - It is the feeling of fainting after a meal
    - Because of undigested food in the intestine- there is an increase osmotic shift of fluid into the GI tract
    - This leads to a reduction of circulating volume
    - This occurs 15-30 min after a meal and is not associated with hypoglycemia

-  ***NIPHS (NON-INSULINOMA PANCREATOGENOUS HYPOGLYCEMIA SYNDROME)***  

- Q. What type of hypoglycemia is seen with NIPHS?
    - Mainly postprandial hypoglycemia
- Q. What are the histological changes seen in NIPHS?
    - The histological changes are called NESIDOBLASTOSIS
    - The beta cell hypertrophies and has enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei
- Q. What are the biochemical changes in NIPHS?
    - They are similar to Insulinoma ie when BG <55 mg/dl there is
        - Insulin > 3 mIU/ml
        - C peptide > 0.6 ng/dl
        - Beta-hydroxybutyrate < 2.7 mmol/l
        - Glucose increases by >25 mg/dl after glucagon
- Q. What are the DD of Nesidoblatosis ?
    - NIPHS
    - Nesdioblastosis in neonates and infants
    - Prolonged use of Sulphonylureas
    - Non-tumor cells in insulinoma
    - Post roux en  Y gastric bypass
- Q. How is NIPHS localized?
    - NIPHS is a diffuse process so not localized
        - However, you need to rule out insulinoma hence localization studies may be required
        - Absence of insulinoma may SUGGEST NIPHS, however it is difficult to distinguish in such  a scenario
        - The best approach would be to do selective arterial calcium stimulation
        - In Insulinoma- there would be a response to a single artery, in NIPHS there would response in multiple arteries
- Q. What is the treatment of NIPHS?
    - In mild to moderate cases
        - Small frequent meals
        - Acarbose / Octreotide
    - In severe cases
        - Partial or subtotal pancreatectomy
        - Region for resection dictated by Selective arterial calcium stimulation

***-  Insulinoma*** 

- Q. Insulinoma is commonly malignant, True or false?
    - False
    - It is mainly benign
    - Malignancy is rare
- Q. What is the demographic of a patient having an insulinoma
    - Mean age- 48 years
    - M > F
- Q. Is the Octerotide scan or DOTA scan a good idea for Insulinoma?
    - No
    - Often does not pick up insulinoma since they often lack SSTR2 receptor
- Q. What is the new functional scan for localization of Insulinoma?
    - GLP-1 scintigraphy
    - ⁶⁸Ga-DOTA-**Exendin**-**4** PET/CT is often used for this purpose
- Q. What will you suspect if there is recurrence or persistence of symptoms post-op in case of an insulinoma?
    - MEN1 syndrome
- Q. What is the surgery done for Insulinoma in MEN1 syndrome?
    - Resection of any visible tumor in the head of the pancreas + distal subtotal pancreatectomy
- Q. Summarize the management of insulinoma in Non-MEN1 cases.

- Q. What is the principle of hepatic artery embolization?
    - Liver has a dual blood supply
    - Normal liver tissue  blood supply from the portal vein
    - Metastasis → blood supply from hepatic artery
    - Hence embolization of hepatic artery – cuts off supply to mets but maintains supply to hepatocytes

    - Q. Which antiviral drug has been known to produce  Hypoglycemia in patients not having diabetes?
        - **Oseltamivir** has been known to produce  Hypoglycemia  in people not having diabetes, especially in the elderly 
        - This has been reported in the article by Kimberlin et al 
            - Ref: Kimberlin DW, Escude J, Gantner J, Ott J, Dronet M, Stewart TA, Jester P, Redden DT, Chapman W, Hammond R. Targeted antiviral prophylaxis with oseltamivir in a summer camp setting. Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine. 2010 Apr 5;164(4):323-7.
-  Exendin scan 
- Q. What is the  Exendin scan  ?
    - This is the PET scan done using Gallium-68 DOTA-Exendin-4 Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography
- Q. What is the sensitivity of the current conventional imaging techniques for preop localization of  Insulinoma?
    - CT- 65-70%
    - MRI- 55-65%
    - Endoscopic ultrasound- 75-80%
- Q. What is the gold standard for preop localization of  Insulinoma?
    - Selective arterial calcium stimulation test
- Q. What is the basis for the Exendin scan?
    - Insulinoma tends to have a high density of  GLP-1  receptor
    - This is detected with an Exendin scan 
- Q. What is the correlation between the Exendin scan can  Gallium DOTANOC scan?
    - GLP1 receptors have high density in 95% of insulinoma
    - Gallium DOTANOC picks up the SSTR2 receptor which is present in 70% of insulinoma
    - Hence Exendin is more sensitive than DOTANOC for insulinoma
    - However, in cases of Exendin negative- DOTANOC can be positive
- Q. Can  Exendin scan have a false positive?
    - This is very rare 
- Q. What about the false negative?
    - This is possible
    - 1. Insulinoma may have have no GLP1 receptor
        - In this case, sometimes they may have SSTR2
        - Hence Gallium DOTANOC can make a diagnosis
    - 2. Renal uptake can cause false negative
        - Intense physiological renal uptake can cause reconstruction artifact which can cause false negative in the adjacent insulinoma in the tail of the pancreas
- Q. What is the common side effect during an Exendin scan?
    - Exendin scan cause produce  Hypoglycemia  - some patients may have nausea and vomiting because of the same
- Q. If an insulinoma has already been detected by another imaging technique- what PET scan would you do to confirm the same?
    - In this case, DOTANOC is preferred over Exendin because of the following reasons:
    - 1. If there is distant mets or poorly differentiated lesion- DOTANOC is more likely to pick up the diagnosis than exendin
    - 2. If required this can be used as a therapeutic agent (theranostic therapy) compared to Exendin which is not suitable as a theranostic agent
