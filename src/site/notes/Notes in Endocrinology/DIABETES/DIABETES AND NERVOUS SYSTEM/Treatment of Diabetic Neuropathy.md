- Q. What are the three main aspects of management of  Diabetic neuropathy  ?
    - Glycemic control
    - Foot care
    - Treatment of pain
- **Glycemic control **
- Q. Does glycemic control IMPROVE diabetic neuropathy?
    - This is an area of debate
    - Many studies including DCCT have shown objective improvement in glycemic control including improvement  in VPT and NCV
    - At present, however, it is believed that once established, diabetic neuropathy cannot be reversed and only progression can be halted by good glycemic control 
- Q. What type of neuropathy can be corrected with glycemic control alone?
    - Acute painful diabetic neuropathy and rapidly reversible hyperglycemic neuropathy – can be corrected with glycemic control alone
    - However, in some cases, rapid improvement in glycemic control can lead to "insulin neuritis"
    - Hence stable glycemia is the aim not under or overtreatment
- **Foot care **
- Q. What are the components of foot care for diabetics?
    - Daily inspection of feet by patients
    - Physician inspection on regular visits
- **Management of painful diabetic neuropathy **
- Q. What are the points of difference between neuropathic pain from ischemic pain in diabetics?

- Q. Does the painful neuropathy spontaneously resolve?
    - In 55% of cases the pain resolves in 12 months
    - This is especially true if there is a recent change in glycemic status and there is a history of painful acute sensory neuropathy which is generally self-resolving
- #Pearl
    - Nerve may discharge spontaneously when it is either being damaged or being repaired
- Q. Does the pain disappear always a good sign?
    - Disappearance of pain can mean either there is improvement in the nerve function or deterioration
    - It is not always a good thing
- **Pain control **
- Q. Enlist the drugs used in the management of Painful diabetic neuropathy.

    - Starting dose of 20-30 mg - escalate up to 120 mg 
    - Must be taken on a full stomach
- Q. Why is the drug not given on empty stomach?
    - It can cause nausea as an important side effect 
- Q. Can it be combined with other SNRI?
    - No
    - But it can be combined with  pregabalin 
- Q. In which related condition, it must be avoided?
    - Avoid patients having restless leg syndrome since it can exacerbate the problem in such patients 
- **Anticonvulsants **
- Q. What is the mechanism of action of Pregabalin?
    - Inhibits presynaptic release of excitatory neurotransmitters
- Q. What is a common but important side effect of Pregabalin?
    - Weight gain
    - Typically about 7% of weight gain is seen
    - Does not impact diabetes control
- Q. How do you dose pregabalin ?
    - Typical starting dose is 75-150 mg/day 
    - Generally given in 2-3 divided doses 
    - Most trials use a starting dose of 150 mg/day 
    - Every 3-7 days, 75 mg dose can be increased to upto 300 mg/day
