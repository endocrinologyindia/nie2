- Q. Why is the term "remission" preferred over "cure" or "reversal" in type 2 diabetes?
    - **A cure** implies:
        - Complete normalization of all aspects of diabetes, which is not the case
        - No need for further clinical follow-up, care, or management
    - **Current Evidence**:
        - There is **no known cure** for type 2 diabetes
    - **Remission** differs from reversal:
        - Implies the need for **ongoing support** to prevent relapse
        - Requires continued lifestyle changes and monitoring
    - **Corollaries for understanding remission**:
        - Similar to states of matter (solid, liquid, gas)
        - Comparable to cancer remission

- Q. What is the complete ADA 2021 consensus definition of diabetes remission?
    - **Definition requires**:
        - **HbA1c**: < 6.5% (< 48 mmol/mol)
        - **Duration**: Maintained for at least **3 months**
        - **Medication Status**: Achieved in the **absence of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy**
    - **Key Components**:
        - **Glycemic Threshold**:
            - Primary: HbA1c < 6.5%
            - Alternative: Fasting blood glucose < 126 mg/dL
        - **Duration**: Minimum 3 months
        - **Medication Status**: No glucose-lowering medications
    - **Additional Requirements**:
        - Ongoing monitoring at least yearly
        - Continued complication screening

- Q. What are the different types of diabetes that can and cannot achieve remission?
    - **Naturally remitting forms**:
        - Glucocorticoid-induced diabetes / Drug-induced diabetes
        - Gestational diabetes
        - Hospital hyperglycemia
        - These serve as natural stress tests for the pancreas
    - **Others that can undergo remission**:
        - Type 2 diabetes
        - Endocrine disorder-induced diabetes:
            - Cushing syndrome
            - Acromegaly

        - Type 1 diabetes
        - Pancreatic diabetes
        - MODY / Monogenic diabetes

- Q. Who are the best candidates with Type 2 diabetes for achieving remission?

- Q. What are all the alternative definitions for remission of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?
    - **Metabolic Remission**:
        - Reversal of insulin secretory defect or insulin resistance
    - **Clinical or Partial Remission**:
        - Achieving HbA1c below individual's set target
    - **Biochemical or Complete Remission**:
        - Reaching HbA1c below threshold for diabetes diagnosis
    - **Pharmacological Remission**:
        - Absence of requirement for any drug therapy

- Q. How is remission classified based on duration?
    - **Duration-Based Categories**:
        - **Transient Remission**: 3-6 months
        - **Short-term Remission**: 6 months to 1 year
        - **Long-term Remission**: 1-5 years
        - **Prolonged Remission**: More than 5 years

- Q. What are the different modes of achieving remission?
    - All modes fundamentally require weight loss:
        - Weight loss by lifestyle measures
        - Weight loss by meal replacement
        - Weight loss with GLP1 RA / other drugs
        - Weight loss with bariatric surgery
        - Early intensive insulin therapy and remission

- Q. What are the findings regarding weight loss and remission across different metabolic disorders?
    - **PCOS**:
        - Modest weight loss (2-5%) improves menstrual irregularities and fertility
        - Final BMI below 26 kg/m²: 78% complete remission rate after bariatric surgery
    - **NAFLD**:
        - 5% or greater weight loss: 75% remission rate within 7-year follow-up
        - High-protein, low glycemic index diet led to improvement with mean weight loss of 6.52 kg
    - **Type 2 Diabetes**:
        - 8-10% weight loss normalized fasting glucose
        - Weight loss was strongest predictor in DiRECT trial
    - **General Targets**:
        - 5-10% improves blood pressure and HDL
        - 10-15% needed for sleep apnea and NASH improvement
    - **Individual Variations** based on:
        - Severity and duration
        - Age, sex, and other characteristics
