- Q. What is the current definition of Diabetes remission?

    - Return of HbA1c <6.5%

    - That occurs either spontaneously or after an intervention

    - Persists for at least 3 months after withdrawal of any glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy

	    - Ref: Riddle MC, Cefalu WT, Evans PH, Gerstein HC, Nauck MA, Oh WK, Rothberg AE, le Roux CW, Rubino F, Schauer P, Taylor R. Consensus report: definition and interpretation of remission in type 2 diabetes. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. 2022 Jan;107(1):1-9.

  

- Q. What is the definition of Diabetes remission?

    - ADA guidelines definition of remission published in 2009

        - THIS HAS NOW BEEN REPLACED (SEE ABOVE)

        - This is also called the "Buse Criteria"


            - Each remission type is composed of 3 components: 

                - (1) the absence of glucose-lowering therapy (GLT)

                - (2) the achievement of a glycemic threshold

                - (3) a duration during which the other 2 components have to be sustained for remission to have occurred

            - Other definitions of remission

                - As follows: 

                    - This is Nagi et al's definition

                    - In the UK, the Primary Care Diabetes Society and the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists responded by publishing a consensus in 2019 which states that "remission can be achieved when a person with type 2 diabetes achieves

                        - 1. Weight loss

                        - 2. HbA1c<48mmol/mol (6.5%) or FPG <7.0mmol/l (126mg/dL) on two occasions separated by six months

                        - 3. Following complete cessation of all GLT"

                    - The International Diabetes Federation discusses remission in the context of bariatric surgery in their 2017 clinical practice recommendations for primary care, where they state "Remission is defined by most guidelines as an HbA1c below 6% (42mmol/mol) without medication for 6 months or more"

  

****Notes from : What's in a Name? Redefining Type 2 Diabetes Remission****

  

- Q. What is Orthorexia nervosa?

    - More about it here : [What to Know About Orthorexia](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/orthorexia-nervosa-101#what-is-orthorexia)

        - Orthorexia, or orthorexia nervosa, is an eating disorder that involves an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating.

  

- Q. What is Drug sensitive remission?

    - This is a terminology proposed by the authors where they suggest that a patient on a stable dose of  Metformin  or a single OAD can also be considered a form of partial remission.

  

- Q. What is the Contemporary Definition of Diabetes remission the authors in this article?

    - Original Article: [What's in a Name? Redefining Type 2 Diabetes Remission](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13300-020-00990-z)

        - Type 2 diabetes remission is defined as a clinical state of health, characterized by achievement of glycemic levels below the targeted level (as decided after shared decision making), maintained for at least 6 months, with or without continued use of lifestyle modification and/or metformin and/or therapy that is also approved for use in non-diabetic individuals, provided that this is not due to concomitant complications, comorbid conditions or therapy that may lead to lowering of drug requirements and is not associated with untoward adverse events.

  

- Q. What are alternative subdefinitions of remission as proposed by the authors?

    - 1. Metabolic remission

        - Reversal of insulin resistance or secretory defect

    - 2. Biochemical remission

        - Achieving normal HBA1c and biochemical parameters

    - 3. Clinical remission

        - Free from diabetes-related complications

    - 4. Pharmacological remission

        - Absence of need for drug therapy

  

****Consensus Report: Definition and Interpretation of Remission in Type 2 Diabetes; Date  November 6th, 2021 ****

  

- Q. What are conditions in which temporary hyperglycemia is seen in clinical practice?

    -  Glucocorticoid induced hyperglycemia 

    -  Gestational Diabetes mellitus (GDM) 

    -  Stress hyperglycemia 

  

- Q. Can diabetes-related complications occur in patients who had hyperglycemia exposure in the past but now having Diabetes remission?

    - Yes

    - Diabetic glomerulopathy can occur in patients with past history of diabetes and currently in remission.

  

- Q. Does the  HbA1c  have a U-shaped curve for mortality?

    - Yes

    - Both lower HbA1c and higher HbA1c in diabetes patients can lead to increased mortality.

    - The former may be due to  Hypoglycemia .

  

- Q. What is Partial, Complete and prolonged remission?

    - This is based on the "Buse criteria."

    - [Defining remission of type 2 diabetes in research studies: A systematic scoping review](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003396)

        - Each remission type is composed of 3 components: 

            - (1) the absence of glucose-lowering therapy (GLT)

            - (2) the achievement of a glycemic threshold

            - (3) a duration during which the other 2 components have to be sustained for remission to have occurred

            - ![](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/figure/image?size=large&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003396.t001)

  

- Q. Are these terminologies still in use?

    - No

    - The current consensus guidelines have recommended termination of these terms like partial, complete remission, etc.

  

- Q. Which is the right term to use - remission, reversal, resolution, cure?

    - The guidelines recommend the use of the term remission.

  

- Q. What is the current definition of Diabetes remission?

    - Return of HbA1c <6.5%

    - That occurs either spontaneously or after an intervention

    - Persists for at least 3 months after withdrawal of any glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy

  

- Q. What is to be done if  HbA1c  is not reliable?

    - FPG <126 mg/dl

    -  CGM  - GMI eAG <6.5%

    - These can be alternative measures.

  

- Q. If an  anti-diabetic  drug is indicated for reasons other than diabetes management and the patient continues to be on the same (for example, SGLT2 is being used for heart failure), will the patient still be considered to be in remission?

    - No

    - The patient will not be defined to have remission.

  

- Q. The opposite of above, if a drug is being used which has a glucose-lowering effect but is not primarily being used for that indication, will the definition of remission be still applicable? (e.g., Orlistat is being used for weight loss)

    - Yes

    - In that case, the diabetes remission definition would be applicable.

  

- Q. How soon after any intervention or procedure should testing and definition for remission be applicable?

    - Lifestyle measures

        - Start testing 6 months after intervention

        - At least 3 months after all drugs have been stopped

    - Medications

        - 3 months after stopping medications

    -  bariatric surgery 

        - Start testing 3 months after surgery and 3 months after stopping any antidiabetic medication

  

- Q. Should the patient be continued to be screened for diabetes-related complications even if the patient is in remission?

    - The concept of metabolic memory says that the patient would continue requiring screening for diabetes-related complications even after stopping diabetes treatment since the patient continues to be at risk because of the prior hyperglycemia.

    - Hence, keep screening for retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease.

  

- Q. Can remission attempts have any adverse effect?

    - Yes, there could be transient worsening of the microvascular complications after rapid glycemic control.

    - e.g., Retinopathy can potentially worsen.

-  ReTUNE study 

    - To test the Personal Fat Threshold concept underlying the etiology of type 2 diabetes with normal BMI:

        - People who develop T2DM have stored more fat than their own body can manage

    - ^^Everybody has a weight threshold - if they cross that they become diabetic^^ - this is the basic idea
