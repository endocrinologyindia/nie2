- Q. What is  Precision diagnosis  ?
    - Involves refining the characterization of diabetes diagnosis for therapeutic optimization or improved prognostic clarity using information about a person's unique biology, environment, and/or context.
    - May involve subclassifying the diagnosis into subtypes, or utilizing probabilistic algorithms that help refine a diagnosis without categorization.
    - Often necessary for successful precision therapy, whether for prevention or treatment.
    - Can be conceptualized as a pathway that moves through stages, rather than a single step.
    - Diagnostic stages include: 
        - 1) evaluation of prevalence based on epidemiology (e.g., age, sex, ancestry); 
        - 2) probability based on clinical features; and 
        - 3) diagnostic tests interpreted in the light of stages 1 and 2.
    - A diagnosis in precision medicine is a probability-based decision, typically made at a specific point in the natural history of a disease, and neither an absolute truth nor a permanent state.
- Q. What are all the inputs into the  Precision medicine in Diabetes  algorithm ?
    - Single gene defects: Characterization of diabetes caused by specific gene defects allows for targeted therapies
    - Islet autoantibody biomarkers: These help clarify autoimmune diabetes from other forms of the disease, facilitating immune intervention trials, preonset monitoring, and detection of environmental triggers.
    - Genomic risk: Assessment of individual genomic risk profiles contributes to better understanding and classification of diabetes subtypes.
    - Multiple biomarkers: Identification of various biomarkers that alter the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) reveals new biological pathways and potential therapeutic targets.
    - Genetic variants: Presence of specific genetic variants can help identify process-specific subgroups in T2D and inform the selection of optimal therapeutic approaches.
    - Biological and lifestyle/environmental predictors: These factors can be used to determine the predictors of drug response and clinical outcomes.
    - Public health strategies: Incorporation of population-level health strategies to address the growing diabetes burden and assess their effectiveness.
    - Pharmacological therapies: Evaluation of the 12 different drug classes currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diabetes treatment.
    - Tools, resources, and data: Utilization of available tools, resources, and data to support the development and refinement of the precision medicine in diabetes algorithm.
    - Collaboration with stakeholders: Broad stakeholder engagement, including partnerships with organizations like ADA, EASD, NIDDK, and JDRF, to ensure the successful implementation of precision diabetes medicine

    - Ahlqvist et al used the following 6 variables in the Swedish cluster to subclassify patients with diabetes mellitus:
        - Age at diagnosis
        - BMI
        - HbA1c
        - GADA (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies)
        - HOMA-beta
        - HOMA-IR

- Q. What is the difference between Acute, Slowly progressive and fulminant type 1 diabetes ?
    - Acute-onset type 1 diabetes (AT1DM) presents with hyperglycemic symptoms and an abolished insulin secretory capacity typically over several weeks to several months.
    - Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or slowly progressive type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (SPIDDM) is characterized by late age at onset, progressive beta-cell failure which is associated with an initial non-insulin-requiring state and an ultimate insulin-dependent state over several years, and persistent islet cell autoantibodies.
    - Fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) is characterized by an extremely rapid process of beta-cell destruction and the progressions of hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis, showing no detectable insulin levels and severe hyperglycemia within the first week
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FV7FPmG7BnB.png?alt=media&token=62ff8c57-892f-4f57-9c0c-24142fb8c449)
- Q. True or false, the fulminant variant of  Type 1 Diabetes  have negative antibodies ?
    - True
    - Because the antibodies often come fast → damage and disappear rapidly
- Q. What are the three stages of type 1 diabetes ?
    - The three stages of type 1 diabetes evolution are:
        - Stage 1: autoantibodies plus normoglycemia.
        - Stage 2: autoantibodies plus asymptomatic dysglycemia.
        - Stage 3: autoantibodies plus symptomatic hyperglycemia.

- Q. Give me a brief about the  SAID cluster (Cluster 1)  ? 
    - SAID cluster is defined by the presence of GADA and includes individuals with multiple autoantibodies, and it is acute-onset or LADA/SPIDDM
    - It is associated with low or depleted insulin secretory capacity, low BMI, and poor glycemic control (high A1c level)
    - SAID features the highest prevalence and incidence of diabetic retinopathy and a risk of fracture
    - Regardless of age groups and rate of progression before symptomatic hyperglycemia, SAID is associated with a risk of ketoacidosis
    - SAID nomenclature is in line with the staging of autoimmune T1DM to optimize the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy of autoimmune diabetes under the rubric of T1DM.
- Q. Which complications are maximum in the  SAID cluster (Cluster 1)  ?
    - Diabetic retinopathy
    - Fracture risk
    -  Diabetic ketoacidosis 
- Q. How does  SAID cluster (Cluster 1)  differ from  SIDD (Cluster 2) 
    - SAID - Has antibody positive 
    - SIDD - Has antibody negative
- Q. Are SIDD also ketosis prone ?
    - Yes. They are
- Q. Give me a brief about  SIDD (Cluster 2)  ?
    - SIDD (Severe Insulin-Deficient Diabetes) is one of the five clusters of adult-onset diabetes mellitus identified through cluster analysis.
    - SIDD is characterized by severe insulin deficiency 
    - Patients in this cluster have a high risk of developing ketoacidosis and microvascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.
    - The therapeutic focus for SIDD is on insulin replacement therapy to address the severe insulin deficiency.
- Q. Give me a brief about  SIRD (Cluster 3)  ?
    - SIRD (Cluster 3) refers to a cluster of adult-onset diabetes mellitus (T2DM) characterized by severe insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.
    - It confers the highest risk of developing diabetic kidney disease, commonly in both Caucasians and non-Caucasians.
    - SIRD may also carry the risk of cancer and dementia due to the association of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia with the onset and progression of these diseases.
    - The frequency of SIRD is not consistent within Asians, as it was slightly lower in Japan but higher in India and China.
- Q. Which complications are higher in  SIRD (Cluster 3)  ?
    -  Diabetic kidney disease 
    -  ASCVD 
    - Dementia
    - Cancer
- Q. Tell me about  MOD (Cluster 4)  ?
    - The characteristic phenotype of MOD includes mild obesity and younger age at diagnosis compared to other subtypes.
    - Patients with MOD have a relatively preserved beta-cell function and moderate insulin resistance.
    - MOD is associated with a lower risk of diabetic complications, such as retinopathy, diabetic kidney disease, neuropathy, and ketoacidosis, compared to other subtypes.
- Q. Finally, tell me about  MARD (Cluster 5)  ?
    - MARD (Cluster 5) is characterized by elderly-onset diabetes with age-related decreases in insulin secretory capacity and insulin sensitivity. 
    - The suspected main causes of MARD are changes in body composition with decreased muscle mass and relatively increased fat mass. 
    - Glycemic control is good, and there were few microangiopathies. 
    - In elderly MARD individuals, attention should be paid to senile syndromes such as frailty syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, osteoporosis and fracture, and ASCVD. MARD is the largest cluster among Caucasians and Asians.
- Q. What are the parameters that should impact choice of medications in  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus  ?
    - 1. Age
    - 2. HBA1c target
    - 3. ASCVD
    - 4. Cost
    - 5. Side effect profile
    - 6. BMI
    - 7. Renal status
    - 8. Liver status
    - 9. hypoglycemia risk
    - 10. Patient preferences
- Q. What is the proposed treatment for  SAID cluster (Cluster 1)  ?
    - Multiple dose insulin or insulin pump
- Q. Should patients with  Latent autoimmune diabetes of Adulthood (LADA)  be given insulin early on, even if they have preserved  Beta-cells  function ?
    - Yes, patients with LADA should be given insulin early on, even if they have preserved beta-cell function. This is because LADA is a slowly progressive autoimmune disease that eventually leads to beta-cell destruction and insulin deficiency. Early insulin therapy has been shown to preserve beta-cell function and improve glycemic control in LADA patients.
- Q. What is the suggested treatment for  SIDD (Cluster 2)  ?
    - Mild beta-cell dysfunction- Secreatgogues, DPP-IV inhibitors etc might work
    - Severe beta-cell dysfunction - Insulin, often  MDI

- Q. Tell me something about  Fetuin-A  ?
    - Fetuin-A is a protein that acts as an endogenous ligand of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4).
    - It promotes lipid-induced insulin resistance.
    - Fetuin-A has been shown to be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its associated cardiometabolic consequences.
    - It is considered as one of the hepatokines, which are proteins secreted by the liver that affect metabolism and insulin sensitivity.
    - More details on  Fetuin-A 
        - Fetuin-A is a novel hepatokine. The number of biologic roles attributed to fetuin-A has increased exponentially in the past decade.
        - Fetuin-A is the endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor-4 activation, for lipid-induced insulin resistance. Fetuin-A has inverse interaction with adiponectin. Increased fetuin-A is a risk factor for diabetes and fatty liver disease in normoglycemia and prediabetes
        - Decreased fetuin-A predicts increased disease activity in obstructive lung disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Both elevated and reduced fetuin-A may be linked with increased cardiovascular events.
        - As a proinflammatory molecule, fetuin-A contributes to insulin resistance and is an important link between liver, adipose tissue, and muscles
        - Fetuin-A is neuroprotective and plays an important antiinflammatory role in sepsis and autoimmune disorders 
- Q. Regarding the  MARD (Cluster 5) , which agent has the highest and the lowest risk of dementia ?
    - Insulin - highest risk
    -  DPP-4  - lowest risk
