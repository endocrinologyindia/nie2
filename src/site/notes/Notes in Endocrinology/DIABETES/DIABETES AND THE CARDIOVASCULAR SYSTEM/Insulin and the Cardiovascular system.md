- Q. What is the effect of Insulin on the endothelium?
    - It has Dual action
        - It increases the release of Nitrous oxide (NO) from the endothelium
        - It is release Endothelin-1 a vasoconstrictor from the endothelium


- Q. What is the effect of Insulin on Vascular smooth muscles?
    - Produces NO in vascular smooth muscles leading to dilatation


- Q. What are the effects of insulin on the heart?
    - Increases Glucose uptake by the heart
    - Increases Cardiac glycogen storage
    - Helps in cardiac contractility
    - Helps in cardiac tissue growth
    - Improves vascular perfusion by dilatation of coronaries


- Q. What is the impact of Insulin on kidney and circulating volume?
    - It increases sodium and water reabsorption from the kidney and increases circulating volume


- Q. What is the impact of insulin on the Sympathetic nervous system (SNS)?
    - Activates the SNS and leads to increase vasoconstriction


- Q. What is the net effect of insulin on blood pressure?
    - There are both vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive effects of insulin
    - The overall net effect is no change in blood pressure because of the insulin


- Q. Summarize the CV effects of Insulin?

- **Insulin resistance and cardiovascular effects **


- Q. What is the overall take on the link between Insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease ?
    - The link between Insulin resistance and Cardiovascular disease is an area of debate. 
    - While the theoretical concept and some indirect clinical data (especially the [[Notes in Endocrinology/ABSTRACTS OF IMPORTANT TRIALS/IRIS trial\|IRIS trial]]) show a link between the two, many direct study show only circumstantial and weak link


- Q. Why is there increase CV risk in patients with insulin resistance?
    - Because insulin resistance is associated with Endothelial dysfunction


- Q. Why does endothelial dysfunction occur in Insulin resistance (IR)?
    - This is a very important concept
    - With Insulin resistance there is selective resistance to the PI3K pathway
    - However, flux through the MAPK pathway is preserved
    - Hence there is less NO production but ET1 production is preserved
    - This is the basis of cardiovascular dysfunction that occurs in diabetics


- Q. What is the role of FFA in cardiovascular damage due to IR?
    - 
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FTd0rYYHmgB.png?alt=media&token=1c159277-2eb3-405a-8b6e-c18612b1303f)
        - IR= Insulin resistance; FFA = Free Fatty acid; SNS = Sympathetic nervous system; ROS=Reactive oxygen species; CV = Cardiovascular


- Q. What is the impact of [[Notes in Endocrinology/DIABETES/PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES/Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)\|Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)]] on CV dysfunction?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F5eeQxS2dDL.png?alt=media&token=605dae66-06b6-4ed5-915a-cb2e1581dc58)


- Q. What is the role of adipocytes?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F8cuHO4rEHb.png?alt=media&token=493cca80-5ee5-4f17-8a66-91b2366ab302)


- Q. What is the net effect of IR on blood pressure?
    - Because of
        - Increase ET1
        - Increase salt and water retention
        - Absence of NO
    - __There is a net increase in blood pressure in IR__


- Q. Summarize the effect of IR on the CV system?
    - Endothelial dysfunction → reduces NO and increase ET1 → net increase of BP
    - Lipotoxicity
    - Glucotoxicity
    - Production of inflammatory adipokines
    - Increase renal sodium resorption
    - Activation of the sympathetic nervous system


- **Therapeutic interventions **


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is very well known to have increased CV risk


- Q. Do lifestyle interventions improve the CV risk produced by IR?
    - Yes
    - Lifestyle measures increase adiponectin and improve CV dysfunction produced by IR


- Q. What is the effect of Thiazolidinones on CV function in IR?
    - TZD improve adiponectin levels and improve endothelial dysfunction
    - They should produce the cardioprotective effect


- Q. IS there any study which has shown this cardiovascular benefit of Pioglitazone?
    - Yes – The [[Notes in Endocrinology/ABSTRACTS OF IMPORTANT TRIALS/PROactive study\|PROactive study]] ^[Dormandy JA, Charbonnel B, Eckland DJ, Erdmann E, Massi-Benedetti M, Moules IK, Skene AM, Tan MH, Lefèbvre PJ, Murray GD, Standl E. Secondary prevention of macrovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes in the PROactive Study (PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events): a randomised controlled trial. The Lancet. 2005 Oct 8;366(9493):1279-89]
        - The results of the study show that pioglitazone had only a modest, and not statistically significant, 10% reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint, which consisted of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and revascularization or amputation.
        - However, the “main secondary endpoint,” consisting only of certain of the primary outcome measures, namely all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke, was significantly reduced by 16%.
    - Another study showing the particular outcome in question is the [[Notes in Endocrinology/ABSTRACTS OF IMPORTANT TRIALS/IRIS trial\|IRIS trial]]
        - __"In this trial involving patients without diabetes who had insulin resistance along with a recent history of ischemic stroke or TIA, the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction was lower among patients who received pioglitazone than among those who received placebo"__ ^[Ref: Kernan WN, Viscoli CM, Furie KL, Young LH, Inzucchi SE, Gorman M, Guarino PD, Lovejoy AM, Peduzzi PN, Conwit R, Brass LM. Pioglitazone after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. N engl J med. 2016 Apr 7;374:1321-31.]
       
- Q. What is the effect of Metformin in this pathway ?
    - Metformin activates the AMPK pathway leading to increase flux through the PI3k pathway leading to increase NO production
    - Hence it will have a benefit on the CV system


- Q. What is the effect of ACEI/ ARB in this scenario?
    - Improves BP
    - Improves endothelial dysfunction
    - Increase adiponectin
    - Reduces CV risk
    - Improve glycemia


- Q. What about statins?
    - They reduce inflammatory cytokines and improve Endothelial function
    - But no effect on insulin resistance


- Q. What is the effect of beta-blockers in this?
    - Beta-blocker worsen insulin sensitivity
    - However alpha1 blocker improve Insulin sensitivity
    - Hence carvedilol which has alpha1 properties is a good beta-blocker for diabetics


- Q. Summarize the effects of various therapeutic interventions on Insulin Resistance and the Cardiovascular system?
    - Lifestyle measures – improve endothelial function
    - TZD – improve –PROactive trial and IRIS trial
    - Metformin – improve
    - ACEI/ ARB- improve
    - Statin- no effect on IR but improve endothelial function
    - Beta-blocker- worsen, carvedilol may improve
