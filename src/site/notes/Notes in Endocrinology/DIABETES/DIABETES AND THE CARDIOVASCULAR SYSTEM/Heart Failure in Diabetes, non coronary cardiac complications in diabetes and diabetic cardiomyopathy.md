## Role of [[ARNI\|ARNI]] in patients with diabetes and heart failure  ([[SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN\|SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN]])

    - In the [[PARADIGM-HF trial\|PARADIGM-HF trial]] at one year follow-up [[SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN\|SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN]] group had lower HbA1c by 13% and at 2 years , 17 % . Overall 14% lower [[HbA1c\|HbA1c]] 


- Q. Does [[SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN\|SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN]] reduce the [[NT-pro-BNP\|NT-pro-BNP]] levels ?
    - Yes
    - Study by Packer et al has shown that there is  25% reduction in NT-proBNP level with sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril in patients with diabetes and HFrEF


- Q. What is the impact of [[SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN\|SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN]] on glycaemic
control and use of insulin in patients with diabetes and HFrEF?
    - ^^[[neprilysin\|neprilysin]] is an enzyme which cleaves many peptides^^
    - ^^One of the peptides it cleaves is [[GLP-1\|GLP-1]]^^
    - ^^Hence [[neprilysin\|neprilysin]] inhibiton can also increase of GLP1 leading to its beneficial effects just like [[DPP-4 inhibitors\|DPP-4 inhibitors]] ^^
    - ^^also it increases [[Bradykinin\|Bradykinin]] which also reduces [[Insulin resistance\|Insulin resistance]] ^^
    - ^^increases [[Adiponectin\|Adiponectin]] and hence cause weight loss^^
    - ^^It can increase [[Angiotensin II\|Angiotensin II]] which can have negative connotations hence it is advised to combine with [[ARB\|ARB]]^^
    - ^^it can increase the levels of IAPP, which can cause beta-cell depletion over time^^
    - ^^Hence long term benefits on glycemic control are not known^^

- Q. With SGLT2i showing promise in HF patients, is there any evidence for use of SGLT2i and ARNI together in HFrEF patients?
    - This question is comprehensively answered by a study by [[Muthiah Vaduganathan et al published in The Lancet in 2020\|Muthiah Vaduganathan et al published in The Lancet in 2020]]
    - In this study, they did a subanalysis of patients receiving all 3 disease-modifying agents- MRA, ARNI, SGLT2 versus conventional therapy of ARB/ACEI and beta-blockers from three largest recent trials EMPHASIS-HF (n=2737), PARADIGM-HF (n=8399), and DAPA-HF (n=4744). 
    - The study found incremental benefit of in the form of reduction in heart failure admission and reduction in death due to heart failure
    - There was also significant survival benefit 
        - Treatment with comprehensive disease-modifying pharmacological therapy was estimated to afford 
            - Admission free interval
                - 2·7 additional years (for an 80-year-old) 
                - 8·3 additional years (for a 55-year-old) free from cardiovascular death or first hospital admission for heart failure 
            - Survival benefit

                - 6·3 additional years (for a 55-year-old) of survival compared with conventional therapy.


20-Jun-2023 [[UPDATES\|UPDATES]]

- Q. Does glycemic control improve the outcome for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes ?
    - This is an area of debate
    - Per se glycemic control alone does not improve outcomes in heart failure
    - Intensive glycemic control has no significant impact on the risk of heart failure in type 2 diabetic patients, as evidenced by a meta-analysis of 37,229 patients (Castagno et al., 2011).
    - The relationship between glycemic control and heart failure was studied in 83,021 patients with type 2 diabetes, and no strong association was found (Lind et al., 2012).
    - ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VA diabetes trials also suggest that intensive glycemic control does not significantly prevent cardiovascular events (American Diabetes Association, American College of Cardiology Foundation, American Heart Association, 2009).
    - However, EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, improved cardiovascular outcomes and reduced mortality in type 2 diabetes patients, indicating that specific glucose-lowering medications might have a positive impact on heart failure outcomes (Zinman et al., 2015).
- Q. True or false, diabetes leads to heart failure and heart failure leads to diabetes ?
    - True: Diabetes can lead to heart failure. Patients with diabetes have a higher risk of developing heart failure due to factors such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and increased inflammation (Seferović et al., 2018; Cavender et al., 2015).
    - True: Heart failure can lead to diabetes. Heart failure is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes, possibly due to factors such as impaired glucose metabolism, increased insulin resistance, and neurohormonal activation (Guglin et al., 2014).
- Q. How does cardiac sympathetic activation in diabetes patients with [[autonomic neuropathy\|autonomic neuropathy]] contribute to heart failure ?
    - Cardiac sympathetic system activation: In diabetes, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is often overactivated, leading to increased catecholamine release and reduced norepinephrine reuptake (Vinik et al., 2003; Maser et al., 2000).
    - Myocardial dysfunction: Overactivation of the SNS contributes to myocardial dysfunction, including impaired contractility, relaxation, and diastolic filling (Boudina et al., 2007).
    - Increased heart rate: SNS overactivation results in an increased heart rate, which can further exacerbate heart failure by increasing myocardial oxygen demand and reducing diastolic filling time (Boudina et al., 2007).
    - Cardiac remodeling: Chronic SNS activation promotes cardiac remodeling, including myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and apoptosis, which can lead to heart failure (Cohn et al., 2000).
    - Arrhythmias: SNS overactivation increases the risk of arrhythmias, which can worsen heart failure and increase the risk of sudden cardiac death (Zipes et al., 1998).
    - RAAS activation: SNS overactivation also stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fluid overload, further contributing to heart failure (Cohn et al., 2000).
