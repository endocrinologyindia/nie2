- Q. What are the 4 main types of health economic evaluations?
    - 1. Cost minimization
    - 2. Cost-effectiveness
    - 3. Cost-utility
    - 4. Cost-benefit

- Q. What are the different types of costs?
    - 1. Direct costs- associated directly with medical treatment - eg: cost of medicines, etc
    - 2. Indirect costs- associated indirectly due to illness- eg: loss of work time - missed wages, etc
    - 3. Intangible costs- they are pain, suffering, grief, etc- things to which we are not able to put a value to it 

- Q. What is cost-minimization analysis?
    - This is the comparison of the same medication manufactured by different companies with different cost 

- Q. What is [[Cost effectiveness\|Cost effectiveness]] analysis ?
    - This is used when we are using different interventions to achieve the same outcome (the outcome is measured in natural units)
    - For example, life years gained, or kilos lost, etc are natural units 
    - Example- diet versus semaglutide for kilos lost is an example of [[Cost effectiveness\|Cost effectiveness]] analysis

- Q. What is the formula for [[Cost effectiveness\|Cost effectiveness]]?
    - Cost-effectiveness = All direct or indirect costs / Benefits measured in terms of life years saved or healthy days
    - It is cost/outcome

- Q. What is Cost utility analysis?
    - This is used when we want to compare different outcomes for different interventions
    - Here we use QALY- the quality of adjusted life years in the denominator
    - For example, we want to compare kidney transplants versus weight loss programs in the public health situation
        - since they measure different outcomes - we use a common denominator called QALY
- 
- Q. How is [[QALY\|QALY]] measured ?
    - QALY = number of years gained x quality of life
    - Quality of life is 0 - being the worst, 1 being the best - so it is a fraction
        - This is measured using various tools like SF-36 etc 
- 
- Q. What is ICER?
    - INCREMENTAL COST EFFECTIVENESS RATO (ICER) 
    - This measures the difference in cost versus the outcome of two different measures

- Q. What is cost- benefit analaysis ?
    - This includes comparisons of all costs - direct, indirect, and intangible with the benefits achieved
