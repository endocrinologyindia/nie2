- Q. What are the current FDA recommendations with the use of  SGLT2i  in the perioperative period?
    - FDA recommends the following:
        - Stop Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin and Bexagliflozin at least 3 days before surgery
        - Stop Ertugliflozin at least 4 days before surgery

- Q. What is the basis for the above recommendation in terms of timing?
    - The typical half-life of  SGLT2i  is 11-13 hours
    - So they are looking at >5 half-lives  

- Q. What is the main concern with the use of  SGLT2i  in the perioperative period?
    - Risk of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) 

- Q. What is  SAPKA ?
    - SGLT2 Inhibitor Associated Perioperative Ketoacidosis (SAPKA)

- Q. When does  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA)  generally occur in these cases?
    - They generally occur in the postoperative period

- Q. True or false, the number of cases reported with  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA)  in literature are increasing over a period of time?
    - True
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F1w6pzzGeYL.png?alt=media&token=39f648d9-87c1-4eb5-84ee-223f526239e1)

- Q. What is the definition of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    - RBS <252 mg/dl with
        - pH <7.3
        - Bicarbonate <15 meq/l
        - Anion gap >12

- Q. What are the typical  Beta-Hydroxybutyrate  levels in patients with  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    - Most cases of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA)  have reported  Beta-Hydroxybutyrate  levels to be more than 2 mmol/l
    - This is more than 20 mg/dl

- Q. Why do  SGLT2i  predispose to  Diabetic Ketoacidosis ?
    - See the diagram below
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FXdSpLLSgeq.png?alt=media&token=d9fcbbd3-ae39-4b68-afe4-c701d0d28716)

- Q. Which is the other mechanism recently being recognized as an important cause of increased ketones in patients on  SGLT2i ?
    - Reabsorption of ketone bodies from urine is seen with the use of  SGLT2i 
    - This also seems to be an important process in this mechanism

- Q. Do  SGLT2i  impact  Glucagon  levels?
    - Yes
    - Patients on SGLT2i have higher glucagon levels
    - However, this impact is indirect

- Q. What are the symptoms of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    - Symptoms may be more subtle sometimes
        - Respiratory distress
        - Gastrointestinal disturbances
        - Malaise

- Q. What are the key points we have learned about  SAPKA  from the meta-analysis by Seki et al?
    - Type of Surgery:
        - Bariatric surgery was the most common type of surgery leading to the diagnosis
    - Time to Diagnosis:
        - Most patients (25.3%) were diagnosed on the first postoperative day (POD 1).
    - Trigger for Identification:
        - Laboratory data was the most frequent trigger for identification (29 cases).
        - Nausea and/or vomiting were reported in 21 cases. 
        - Breath shortness/dyspnea was a trigger for 20 cases.
        - Fatigue or malaise was reported by 14 patients.
        - Tachycardia and tachypnea were observed in 16 and 15 cases respectively.
    - Blood Ketones and Median BGA Data:
        - The median blood BHB level was 5.8 mmol/L
        - The mean anion gap was 23 meq/l 
        - The median pH value at the time of diagnosis was 7.16, with a range from 6.82 to 7.29.

- Q. Do patients receiving  SGLT2i  for non-diabetes indications like heart failure and CKD are also at risk of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    - No
    - Non-diabetic patients have NOT been reported to have  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) 
        - Update- Just one case has been reported as suggested by the meta-analysis by Seki et al (see reference below)
    - Hence in such cases it may be okay to continue SGLT2i preoperatively
    - However they may develop stress hyperglycemia in the perioperative period and hence this has to be kept in mind
    - The guideline recommends getting an anion gap done post-operatively in such patients to rule out  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) 

- Q. What is the perioperative recommendation for patients with diabetes in whom the  SGLT2i  have been stopped at an adequate period prior to surgery?
    - The patient can go ahead with surgery with perioperative use of insulin as appropriate
    - However if post-operatively the diet is not resumed within 2 hours it is recommended to get an anion gap done
    - It has to be repeated every 12 hourly after till the carbohydrate in diet is resumed

- Q. Why is this required even for patients in whom the drug has been adequately stopped?
    - This is because the effect of  SGLT2i  have been shown to persist for a longer time even in patients in whom the drug was discontinued and even with normal renal function
    - Cases of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA)  have been reported as long as 10 days after discontinuation of the drug  

- Q. What to do in diabetic patients on SGLT2i when emergency surgery is required?
    - Check  Beta-Hydroxybutyrate  and anion gap to ensure that the patient is not currently in DKA
    - If the patient is having DKA- see if emergency surgery can be postponed
    - Else it is recommended to carry out the procedure as usual looking at risk vs benefit

- Q. What is done if the patient shows up for surgery without stopping the medication as suggested?
    - Check anion gap
        - If >12 → postpone surgery
        - If <12 → can go ahead with surgery with good insulinization but make sure that the patient is not having a fasting period of >12 hours

- Q. Give an outline of what to do perioperatively in patients with SGLT2i undergoing surgery?
    - Step 1:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FF4mmc83MZ1.png?alt=media&token=6d7561b0-0ab4-482d-802e-0226b75ba320)
    - Step 2A - Emergency surgery
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FqMQ3p1aaPg.png?alt=media&token=59169452-7347-4184-9b6b-2a35d214f41a)
    - Step 2B- Elective surgery
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FYNGaWpRLq0.png?alt=media&token=cc9c2f12-7871-49fb-bb8a-e770d5c1ffa3)

- Q. What should be done intraoperatively in all these patients?
    - Monitor blood glucose and give insulin infusion
        - With dextrose if glucose <200 mg/dl

- Q. What is done post-operatively?
    - It would be a good idea to check the anion gap - if there is going to be a delay of >2 hrs on starting carbohydrate meal
    - If the patient is to be discharged immediately- then it is a good idea to check the glucose and anion gap at discharge- consider insulin if required
        - After day of the surgery if the patient is taking orally- they can restart the SGLT2i
    - If the patient is going to be admitted- then continue insulin infusion with dextrose till oral intake is resumed and then put the patient on subcutaneous insulin as per protocol
        - Check the anion gap 4-12 hourly depending on the perioperative risk

- Q. Which surgery are considered high risk vs low risk in terms of risk of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    - Factors suggesting low risk:
        - Procedure <1 hr for GA, local or regional anesthesia
        - Total anticipated NPO duration <12 h 
        - Pre-op A1C <8%
        - Pre-op blood glucose <150 mg/dl
        - Not on insulin as outpatient
        - No significant background comorbidity
    - Factors suggesting higher risk:
        - Procedure >1 hour or requiring general anesthesia
        - Total anticipated NPO duration >12 h
        - Pre-op A1C >8
        - Pre-op blood glucose >150 mg/dl 
        - On insulin as outpatient
        - Significant background comorbidity (e.g., trauma, MI, etc).

- Q. How do you manage  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    - Management is the same as other causes of DKA, only that you might have to give dextrose containing IV fluids since the glucose <250 mg/dl
    - Here is the outline of stepwise management:
        - Step 1: Stop inciting agent, if applicable (e.g., SGLT2i)
        - Step 2: Start fluid replacement with monitoring of electrolytes and ketones
        - Step 3: Start continuous insulin infusion
        - Step 4: Start dextrose administration
        
- Q. Apart from insulin and dextrose, which drug has been proposed for potential treatment for  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    -  Somatostatin 
    - Somatostatin was suggested for treatment of  Diabetic Ketoacidosis  way back in 1980, but hasn't been used much because of better insulin available
    - With the advent of  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA)  , the use of the same is emerging as evidenced by the case report Torre et al
    - The mechanism of action proposed is reduction of glucagon levels by the use of this agent

- Q. Is there any role of somatostatin analogue octreotide in  Euglycemic Ketoacidosis (eDKA) ?
    - There are mixed data to support the use of  Octreotide  for this purpose
    - Several papers (Burge et al, Yun et al) have shown little or no benefit of the use of  Octreotide  in conventional  Diabetic Ketoacidosis 
    - One paper by Diem et al shows that it is useful to prevent recurrence of DKA in patients with recent DKA
