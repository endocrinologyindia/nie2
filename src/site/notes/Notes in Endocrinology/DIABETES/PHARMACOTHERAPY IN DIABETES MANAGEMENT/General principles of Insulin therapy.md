- Q. What is the structural difference between insulin aspart and regular human insulin?
    - Aspartic acid replaces proline at B28 position in Insulin Aspart 


- Q. When is the peak seen in premix insulin?
    - Remember, in premix insulin, when the regular and NPH are combined, both tend to have a single common peak
    - This is less of a problem with insulin analog combined with NPH


- Q. What happens to the peak when the concentration of NPH and Regular insulin are changed?
    - In 50:50 insulin – the peak occurs earlier and higher insulin concentration in the first 6 hours compared to 70:30 insulin


- Q. Can insulin glargine and detemir be combined with other insulins?
    - No
    - This is because they have an acidic pH


- Q. Give the onset, peak, and duration of various insulin?
    - Lispro/Aspart/Glulisine
			- Onset- 5-15 min
			- Peak- 45-75 min
			- Duration - 2-4 hours

		Regular human insulin
			- Onset-30 min
			- Peak- 2-4 hours
			- Duration - 5-8 hours

		NPH
			- Onset- 2 hours
			- Peak- 4-12 hours
			- Duration - 18-28 hours

		Glargine U100
			- Onset- 2 hours
			- Peak- None
			- Duration - 22-24 hours

		Degludec
			- Onset- 2 hours 
			- Peak- None
			- Duration -36-40 hours
   
		
- Q. Are these timings always the same in all patients?
    - No
    - They are based on small doses given to normal subjects
    - It may vary in the clinical situation


- Q. Is the absorption of insulin consistent?
    - No
    - It may vary by 25-50%  in the same person 
    - Variation is most with NPH and least with rapid-acting analogs
    - It is also seen with glargine


- Q. What is the relation between detemir dose and duration?
    - Higher the dose of detemir, longer the duration


- Q. What is the relation between the subcutaneous depot and variability?
    - Larger the subcutaneous depot, the more the variability and lesser the absorption
    - Hence Insulin pumps do very well because they have a tiny depot


- Q. What are jet injectors?
    - They produce a smaller depot and less painful
    - However, they are expensive and difficult to maintain
    - Hence not recommended at present


- Q. What is the most significant advantage of a pen over a syringe and vial?
    - When small doses are used- less than five units, syringe produces more errors than pen


- Q. What is the difference between shallow injections and deep injections?
    - Shallow injections produce intradermal injection – more negligible effect
    - Deep injections produce intramuscular injections – a more rapid effect


- Q. What is the microfine and ultrafine needle?
    - Microfine – 27 G
    - Ultrafine – 29 G


- Q.  What are the sites for injection?
    - Upper arm
    - Upper leg
    - Abdomen
    - Buttocks


- Q. Which site has the fastest and which has the slowest absorption?
    - Abdomen- fastest
    - Slowest –leg and buttocks
    - Arm – intermediate


- Q. What type of insulin is given where?
    - Give premeal bolus insulin at abdomen- faster absorption is more useful
    - Give basal insulin at the buttocks and legs- slower absorption- prolonged duration of action


- Q. How is insulin stored?
    -   A strict cold-chain must be maintained when stored and transported from manufacturer to storage facility to Pharmacy
	-   Unopened cartridges, Pre-filled pens and vials must be stored at 2-8 °C
  
	-   In-use cartridges, Pre-filled pens and vials must be stored at 15-30°C
    
	-   Typically patients as asked to store it in refrigerators on the side compartment (an not Frozen)
    
	-   Pens are stored WITHOUT the needle-cap on. If stored with the needle-cap air can enter the cartridge causing clogging or the thermo-insulation can leak
    
	-   In areas with inconsistent electricity or no refrigeration, it can be stored in Earthen pots (Matkas) with water.

- Q. What is the shelf-life of insulin?
    - Advised to look at product monograph for exact shelf-life for insulin-in-use.
    - On an Average, it is 28 days.


- Q. Whare care must be taken during the transport of insulin?
    - Exposure to temperatures  more than 30 degrees must be avoided 
    - Can be kept in handbag, flasks or special pouches for this purpose 
    - During air-travel it must be in the hand luggage and not in the check-in luggage 


- Q. How much potency is required for the insulin to be adequate?
    - Insulin should retain a potency of at least 95% to be effective


- Q. At an Indian room temperature of 32-37 degrees, how much potency is reduced?
    - According to a study, the potency of insulin reduced by 15% in the Indian climate if insulin is NOT properly stored
