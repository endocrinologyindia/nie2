- Q. What part of the immune system is most affected in diabetes?
    - Innate immunity

- Q. What are the effects of diabetes on neutrophil function?
    - Reduced neutrophil phagocytosis
    - Reduces chemotaxis of neutrophils


- Q. Summarize the risk factors which make persons living with diabetes more susceptible to infection?
    - Primary factors
        - Reduced neutrophil chemotaxis
        - Reduced neutrophil phagocytosis
        - Reduced adherence to vascular endothelium
        - Reduced intracellular bactericidal activity
        - Opsonization defect
        - Cell-mediated immunity defect
    - Secondary factors
        - Ischemia and peripheral vascular disease
        - Sensory neuropathy
        - Autonomic neuropathy
        - Urine retention
        - Gastroparesis  and Intestinal dysmotility
        - Glycosuria
        - Increase skin, mucosal and nasal colonization- MRSA in the nose and Candida colonization is common in diabetics


- Q. What is the relation between vascular disease and infection?
    - Vascular insufficiency  ischemia → increases the growth of anaerobic bacteria


- Q. Enlist the diabetes-specific infections, also called "Diabetes defining illness."
    - Diabetic foot infection
    - Mucormycosis
    - Recurrent UTI including fungal UTI
    - Candidiasis – balanitis, vulvovaginitis, esophageal candidiasis
    - Malignant otitis externa
    - Emphysematous pyelonephritis
    - Emphysematous cholecystitis
    - Pyomyositis
    - Necrotizing fascitis


- Q. Why is mucormycosis more common in patients having diabetic ketoacidosis?
    - Rhizopus grows better in acidic and high glucose environment
    - They have __ketone reductase enzyme __which protects them


- Q. Why is Candida Albicans more common in people with diabetes?
    - Candida produces certain factors which are induced by glucose
    - These factors help candida adhere to the mucosa


- Q. Which infection has a link with a Glibenclamide?
    - Burkholderia pseudomallei, which produce mallediosis, is more common in people with diabetes in endemic area
    - They have an increase risk of mortality with Glibenclamide


- Q. Why is E. coli infection in the bladder more common in people with diabetes?
    - Advanced glycosylated end products increase binding of E. coli with bladder wall
