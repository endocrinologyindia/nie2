- Q. Which organisms produced mucormycosis?
    - Fungi from the Mucorales order produce mucormycosis in human beings
    - They include:
        - Rhizopus
        - Mucor
        - Rhizomucor
        - Cunninghamella
        - Saksenaea
        - Apophysomyces


- Q. What is the most devastating syndrome associated with mucormycosis and diabetes? 
    - Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis
    - Pulmonary mucormycosis 


- Q. What produces Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM)?
    - Inhalation of spores of these fungi in susceptible patients produces this syndrome of ROCM


- Q. Which are the other organs that can be potentially involved?
    - Skin
    - GI tract
    - Renal
    - Disseminated disease


- Q. Where are the Mucorales organisms found in nature?
    - They are ubiquitous
    - They are often found in decaying vegetation and the soil


- Q. Do people with an intact immune system develop mucormycosis?
    - No
    - Only people with compromised immunity develop mucormycosis 


- Q. What are the differences in hyphae of mucormycosis versus hyphae of aspergillus?

        - Lactophenol cotton blue (LCB) mount from the growth revealed aseptate hyphae with nodal rhizoids and short sporangiophores with terminal spherical sporangia filled with brownish sporangiospores, suggestive of __Rhizopus microsporus__ 
       
- Q. The lack of septations has a clinical consequence in mucormycosis. What is the clinical consequence of the same?
    - The lack of septations makes the fungus fragile and hence the fungus finds it difficult to grow unless they have a very conducive environment
    - It is also difficult to culture the same in the lab
    - Specimens containing suspected mucormycosis must be finely minced to prevent damaging the hyphae 


- Q. Which chelating agent is known to increase the risk of mucormycosis?
    - Deferoxamine 


- Q. Why does Deferoxamine increase the risk of mucormycosis?
    - The deferoxamine and iron bind together to form feroxamine
    - This is a siderophore for the species Rhizopus allowing increasing iron uptake by the organism and hence increasing their growth and tissue invasion


- Q. Do other chelating agents like deferasirox also increase the risk of mucormycosis?
    - No
    - They do not form siderophores and hence do not increase the risk of mucormycosis
    - They may be protective 
    - However, adequate studies for any benefit of the same in humans are missing


- Q. What is a siderophore?
    - Siderophore are organic compounds that help transport iron inside the cell of an organism


- Q. Why do we see necrosis and infarction in patients having mucormycosis?
    - This is because the fungal hyphae are angioinvasive 
    - The invasion of the vasculature of the host leads to necrosis and infarction


- Q. Why does Mucormycosis thrive in a ketogenic environment?
    - The Rhizopus species has an enzyme called KETONE REDUCTASE 
    - This helps to breakdown the ketone as fuel for these fungi


- Q. Is there any additional pathology in diabetic ketoacidosis which helps the fungi grow?
    - Presence of free iron is high in Diabetic ketoacidosis 
    - Again, this becomes a vehicle for the fungi to grow


- Q. Broadly what are the risk factor for Mucormycosis?
    - Diabetes mellitus with Ketoacidosis
    - Use of Deferoxamine
    - Increased iron stores 
    - Treatment with glucocorticoids
    - COVID-19 infection with diabetes and glucocorticoid use
    - Post-transplant
    - AIDS
    - Injection drug use
    - Burns
    - Malnutrition
    - Hematological malignancies


- Q. Do all patients with Mucormycosis have pre-existing diabetes?
    - No
    - Only 30-40% of patients have pre-existing diabetes
    - Some of the others are diagnosed to have new onset of diabetes
    - In the era of COVID-19, the development of Mucormycosis has been rampant, especially in patients having steroid-induced diabetes


- Q. Is mucormycosis diabetes defining illness?
    - Yes


- Q. What type of mucormycosis infection is common with diabetes?
    - Rhino-oculo-cerebral mucormycosis is common with diabetes


- Q. Why has the incidence of mucormycosis in diabetes reduced in many countries? 
    - The incidence of mucormycosis in diabetes has reduced considerably
    - One theory is that this is because of the widespread use of statins in diabetes
    - Statins have an inhibitory effect on the growth of these fungi 
   	- *"Exposure of R. oryzae to statins at concentrations below their MICs decreased virulence both in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation is warranted into the use of statins as adjunctive therapy in mucormycosis" * 


- Q. Apart from diabetes, what is the second most common underlying risk factor?
    - Hematologic malignancies


- Q. What are the common sources of Mucor in hospital settings?

        - 
- **Diagnosis**


- Q. If a fungus from this group is isolated in a specimen, does it prove that the patient has mucormycosis?
    - It is important to note that the fungi from this family are common contaminants in cultures and isolation of the fungi does not necessarily prove that the patient is having mucormycosis unless the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of the disease

- Q. Is the nephrotoxicity due to AMPHOTERICIN B DEOXYCHOLATE reversible?
    - Yes
    - It is potentially reversible
    - There is a transient increase in creatinine in almost all patients
    - Severe renal dysfunction due to the drug alone is rarely reported
    - Basically, volume contraction is the likely culprit- which if corrected can be useful


- Q. What can be done to prevent nephrotoxicity?
    - 1. Prefer liposomal preparation
        - It is advisable to switch to liposomal preparation if Creatinine is >2.5 mg/dl
    - 2. Avoid volume contraction
        - Potentially 250 mg of Normal saline before and after the infusion may be useful


- Q. What are the common electrolyte imbalances following the infusion?
    - Hypomagnesemia
    - Hypokalemia 
    - Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
    - This is all due to an increase in distal tubular membrane permeability 


- Q. What are the adverse hematological effects?

    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2Fi3rv-H-M40.png?alt=media&token=c654e280-8ea3-481e-8d69-357e8aabc106)


- Q. How do glucocorticoids increase the risk of infections?
    - Glucocorticoids also impact Polymorphs function - it leads to Impairment in the neutrophil migration ingestion, and phagolysosome fusion


## Author's personal views 

> *We are seeing a massive upsurge in cases of Mucormycosis after COVID-19 infection. There are many theories for the same, however, one of the most important reasons is undiagnosed and untreated hyperglycemia. 47% of India's population is NOT AWARE that they have diabetes. Many of them are then given glucocorticoids without paying heed to their glycemic status. In all cases of diabetes (steroid-induced or otherwise) the only thing that works is pre-emptive or preventive action. Once the [[Notes in Endocrinology/DIABETES/PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES/Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)\|Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)]] cycle begins, it is difficult to bring it back to base level for several days*. __*A simple act of checking a random sugar before the first dose of steroid and pre-empting the action of steroid can go a long way in preventing severe hyperglycemia and hopefully Mucormycosis. We will come out with a note on the management of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 soon*__

- Q. What can be done to prevent more cases of mucormycosis secondary to COVID-19 infection ? (Expert opinion) ?
	- 1. Rhino-oculo-cerebral mucormycosis is a diabetes defining illness. Mucormycoisis without diabetes or hematological disorder is very rare. Many of the patients with mucormycosis have undiagnosed diabetes mellitus. It is imperative that all patients with COVID-19 and all patients with mucomycosis be checked for Diabetes mellitus
	- 2. Patients given glucocortoicoids for home-care or in hospitals, must be checked for diabetes BEFORE starting the glucocorticoids. If they do have diabetes, the glucose should be intensely controlled. Expert opinion may be sought if management of hyperglycemia poses serious challenges. 
	- 3. Statins may have a role in prevention of mucormycosis. It is also important to remember that statins are INDICATED in almost all adult patients with diabetes mellitus since people living with diabetes are considered to have high cardiovascular risk. Administration of statins in patients with diabetes mellitus should be considered a priority,

	- Patient with Mucormycosis post COVID-19. The interesting thing about this patient is that the patient had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 and home treated, **but was NOT GIVEN STEROIDS. **
	- Hyperglycemia seems to be the important parameter for Post-COVID-19 mucormycosis and NOT steroids themselves
