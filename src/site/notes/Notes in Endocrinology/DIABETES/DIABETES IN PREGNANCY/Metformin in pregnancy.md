<br> - Q.  What are the rationale for the use of metformin in pregnancy?<br>  
    - 1. Treatment of  Gestational Diabetes mellitus (GDM)  
    - 2. Treatment of  pregestational diabetes  
    - 3. Patients on  PCOS   becoming pregnant
    - 4.  Gestational obesity  
<br> - Q.  What is the category for metformin in pregnancy?<br>  
    - Metformin is in pregnancy category B
    - This is the same as  insulin  
    -  Category B   is defined as 
        - "Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk, but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters)."
<br> - Q.  Does first-trimester exposure to metformin produce congenital abnormalities?<br>  
    - No
    - Case-control study by Given et al. found no congenital abnormalities
    - There was the chance finding of increased pulmonary atresia, but this was more likely to be a chance finding 
  	- "No evidence was found for an increased risk of all non-genetic congenital anomalies combined following exposure to metformin during the first trimester, and the one significant association was no more than would be expected by chance. Further surveillance is needed to increase sample size and follow up the cardiac signal, but these findings are reassuring given the increasing use of metformin in pregnancy" ^[Given JE, Loane M, Garne E, Addor MC, Bakker M, Bertaut-Nativel B, Gatt M, Klungsoyr K, Lelong N, Morgan M, Neville AJ. Metformin exposure in first trimester of pregnancy and risk of all or specific congenital anomalies: exploratory case-control study. bmj. 2018 Jun 25;361.]
<br> - Q.  Can metformin be used in the management of Gestational obesity?<br>  
    - Rationale- metformin can potentially prevent maternal weight gain and reduce the risk of GDM in pregnancy 
    - RCT has shown that metformin does prevent maternal weight gain
    - Reduces risk of preeclampsia 
    - Also reduces the risk of neonatal ICU admission 
    - However, it does not prevent GDM
    - It also does not reduce the risk for large for gestational age babies 
	
## Use of Metformin in Pregestational diabetes 

<br> - Q.  What is the  MITY study?<br>  
    - This is the study done to see the effect of metformin in women with type 2 diabetes and pregnancy
    - This is an RCT
    - Women were already on insulin
    - Women were randomized to receive metformin 1 gram BD versus placebo added to insulin 
    - The results were encouraging
    - The study found better glycemic control with the use of metformin and less large for gestational age infants
    - However, the risk of small for gestational age was increased 
<br> - Q.  Overall, what is the understanding of metformin with regards to the size of infants?<br>  
    - Clearly, metformin produces smaller infants
    - but there might for a post-natal growth acceleration leading to large children at a later date 
<br> - Q.   Which guidelines support the use of metformin for  Hyperglycemia in pregnancy?<br>  
    - 1. NICE guidelines
    - 2. Society for Maternal-fetal medicine
<br> - Q.  What are the benefits of the use of metformin in  Hyperglycemia in pregnancy?<br>  
    - 1. Less pregnancy weight gain
    - 2. Less hypoglycemia
    - 3. Better patient acceptability
    - 4. Reduces risk of  preeclampsia  
    - 5. Reduces risk of  preterm delivery  
<br> - Q.  What are the benefits of metformin over insulin in  Hyperglycemia in pregnancy?<br>  
    - 1. Lower Large for Gestational age babies
    - 2. Less neonatal hypoglycemia
    - 3. Less neonatal ICU admission
<br> - Q.  What are the biggest challenge with the use of  Metformin in pregnancy?<br>  
    - 1. High rate of ineffectiveness as a form of treatment for  Hyperglycemia in pregnancy  
        - 46% of women on metformin required insulin (Rowan et al. 2008)
    - 2. Metformin does cross the placenta (however, it does not seem to have any adverse fetal effects)
    - 3. Long term impact is NOT known 
<br> - Q.  Is metformin in pregnancy safe?<br>  
    - Yes
    - Conclusion for meta-analysis of 6 RCT have concluded that the use for metformin in pregnancy is safe 
<br> - Q.  Does the metformin use in the first trimester of pregnancy associated with an increased risk of fetal teratogenicity?<br>  
    - No
    - Several studies and meta-analyses have been reassuring of this
<br> - Q.  What are the issues with  PCOS   women becoming pregnant?<br>  
    - The odds of several complications in pregnancy are more with women having PCOS compared to normal women
    - This makes continuing metformin in these women an attractive option
<br> - Q.  Does continuing or starting metformin in women with PCOS have any benefit?<br>  
    - The conclusion comes from an RCT by Vanky et al
    - They found 
        - No effect of prevention of GDM in these women with metformin use (some other studies have shown that it does prevent GDM)
        - The main benefit was a reduction of preterm delivery
            - This is in contrast to other situations where the use of metformin is associated with higher preterm birth
<br> - Q.  What are the long-term impact of the use of  Metformin in pregnancy when used in the context of  Hyperglycemia in pregnancy?<br>  
   
   - 18 months
        - Children exposed to metformin are taller and heavier compared to their counterparts not exposed to metformin
        - No neurodevelopmental issues
    - 2 years
        - Large skinfold thickness in children exposed to metformin in fetal life
        - But DEXA did not show a difference in fat percentage
    - 9 Years
        - meta-analysis clearly shows that in utero exposure lead to heavier and taller children 
        - Also, DEXA fat mass is more 
        - Hence since they are heavier and taller, the BMI z scores were not different compared to the control
        - Main data from this meta-analysis comes from the  MIG-TOFU study  
<br> - Q.  Is metformin secreted in breast milk?<br>  
	  - Yes
<br> - Q.  What is the  MiG trial ?<br>  
		- This is the most important trial comparing the use of metformin and insulin in GDM patients
		- 46% of patients on metformin did require insulin
		- However, the composite endpoint of perinatal outcomes was the same in the metformin and the insulin group
		- There was no adverse effect with the use of metformin
		- 70% of the women preferred using metformin over insulin

## Metformin in pregnancy  - Summary, and conclusions
- 1. Treatment of  Gestational Diabetes mellitus (GDM)  
    - Use insulin as the first line of therapy
    - Metformin can be add on therapy 
    - this is as per guidelines
    -  MiG trial   may be useful here 
- 2. Treatment of  pregestational diabetes  
    -  MITY study  
    - Found benefit of using Insulin + metformin versus insulin + placebo
    - Must be used
- 3. Patients on  PCOS   becoming pregnant
    - Venky et al. found no major benefit for the prevention of GDM and other parameters
    - In some parameters, it was useful
    - Can be used till the end of the first trimester then stopped 
- 4.  Gestational obesity  
    - There is no indication for use
    - Does not prevent GDM
    - No major benefit
    - Don't use
