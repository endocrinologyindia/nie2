- Q. Which are the primary pathways implicated in hyperglycemia-induced microvascular damage?
    - Accumulation of [[Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)\|Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)]] 
    - Accumulation of sorbitol  (Polyol flux pathway)
    - Hexosamine flux pathway
    - Increase protein kinase C


- **Polyol flux pathway **
- Q. Describe the sorbitol pathway?
    - Glucose is converted by Aldose reductase into sorbitol


- Q. What are the consequence of sorbitol accumulation?
    - Depletion of NADPH
    - Increased cell osmolality
    - Decrease in intracellular myoinositol


- Q. Why is depletion of NADPH critical?
    - NADPH is required for scavenging of radical oxygen species
    - Reduction of NADPH reduces the ability of the cell to scavenge reactive oxygen species


- Q. Summarize the polyol flux pathway with a diagram

- [[Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)\|Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)]]


- Q. Give the sequence of formation of AGE?

- Q. Which are the three precursors of AGE?
    - Glyoxal
    - Methylglyoxal
    - 3-Deoxyglucosone


- Q. What are RAGE?
    - Receptor for AGE


- Q. Describe the consequences of AGE?
    - Glucose binds to protein  formation of AGE:
    - Crosslinking of AGE
    - AGE binding with RAGE → proinflammatory pathway activated


- **Hexosamine pathway **


- Q. Describe the Hexosamine flux pathway?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2Foo223Y69HF.JPG?alt=media&token=b06a7649-7ceb-47fc-ba2a-49b50e986307)


- Q. What does UDP N glucosamine do ?
    - UDP N- glucosamine glycosylates transcription factors leading to increased transcription of certain proteins like TGF-beta, PAI-1, etc


- Q. What happens to the hexosamine pathway?
    - Increase in glucose leads to increase flux through the hexosamine pathway
    - This leads to increase in the formation of ROS and disruption of various cell transcription factor


- Q. Which drug reduces the flux of glucose via the hexosamine pathway?
    - Benfotiamine


- **Protein kinase c **


- Q. What is the importance of protein kinase C?
    - Increase glucose  increase diacylglycerol → increase protein kinase C


- Q. What are the consequences of protein Kinase C activation?
    - Increase VEGF
    - Increase TGF beta
    - Increase NAPH oxidases  increase ROS
    - Increase PAI-1 → increase thrombosis
    - Increase Nk-kb → increase proinflammatory cytokines
    - increased endothelin 1 →vasoconstriction


- Q. Which is the protein kinase C inhibitor?
    - Ruboxistaurin


- Q. Does the protein kinase C pathway affect microvascular complications only?
    - No
    - It can lead to both microvascular and macrovascular complications


- Q. What isoforms of PKC produce what in diabetic nephropathy?
    - PKC alpha- albuminuria
    - PKC beta – glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial expansion
    - Both increase reactive oxygen species


- Q. Describe the IP3 /DAG pathway?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FO5X-1IsNqC.JPG?alt=media&token=1794a567-e4e8-4063-aff9-8fa15ff3938f)
    - DAG is increased in Diabetes and hence more production of Protein Kinase C


- **Oxidative stress **


- Q. What is the role of oxidative stress in the whole process?
    - Oxidative stress in the final common pathway for all the metabolic processes described above


- **PARP (Poly-ADP ribose polymerase)**


- Q. What is PARP?
    - Poly-ADP ribose polymerase


- Q. What is the role of PARP in diabetic neuropathy?
    - Increased glucose  activates PARP
    - PARP destroys NAD+
    - This leads to increase free radicals and disruption of the DNA transcription process
    - It also reduced G6PDH, which is a critical pathogenic factor


- Q. What is the importance of G6PDH?
    - Glyceraldehyde 6 phosphate dehydrogenase is a crucial enzyme in the glucose metabolism
    - This is inhibited by PARP
    - This leads to the accumulation of Glyceraldehyde 6 phosphate, which is shunted to produce DAG (Protein kinase C) and Methylglycoxal (which produces AGE)


- Q. Describe some charts showing unifying pathways for diabetic microvascular complications and the role of G6PDH?
