-  obstructive sleep apnea OSA 
<p></li> - Q. What is the definition of OSA ? </p><li>
</li><li>"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder that is characterized by obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and/or respiratory effort-related arousals caused by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep"
</li><li>Day time somnolence and  at least 5 episodes of obstructive breathing during sleep defined by 
    </li><li>Apnea- lasting for 10s
    </li><li>Hypopnea- 50% reduction of airflow – lasting for >10 s  
<p></li> - Q. What is classical triad of OSA ? </p><li>

<p> - Q. What are the testing options for  obstructive sleep apnea OSA  ?
</li><li>1.  Polysomnography 
    </li><li>Full night study
    </li><li>Split night study 
        </li><li>Here in the first part of the night the diagnostic evaluation is done
        </li><li>In the second part- the titration of PAP therapy is done
</li><li>2. Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT)
<p></li> - Q. What is the gold standard for diagnosis of OSA ? </p><li>
</li><li>Polysomnography 
<p></li> - Q. Which patients should be subjected to  Polysomnography  ?
</li><li>excessive daytime sleepiness plus two or more of the following:
    </li><li>1. Snoring
    </li><li>2. Witnessed apnea
    </li><li>3. Gasping during sleep
    </li><li>4. Choking during sleep
    </li><li>5. Witnessed apnea 
- #Pearl  - Unexplained pulmonary hypertension may be due to OSA
<p></li> - Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for  obstructive sleep apnea OSA  based on  Polysomnography  ?
</li><li>1.  Asymptomatic patients
    </li><li>15 or more episodes of Apnea, Hypopnea or RERA (Respiratory effort related arousal)  per hour
</li><li>2. Symptomatic patients
    </li><li>5 or more episodes per hour 
    </li><li>The "symptoms" include:
        </li><li>Sleepiness, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, or insomnia symptoms
        </li><li>Waking up with breath-holding, gasping, or choking
        </li><li>Habitual snoring, breathing interruptions, or both noted by a bed partner or other observer
        </li><li>Hypertension, mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus
<p></li> - Q. What is apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ?
</li><li>Apnea + hypopnea in total / total sleep duration in hours = this will give per hour estimate
<p></li> - Q. What is respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ?
</li><li>Apnea + hypopnea + RERA in total / total sleep duration in hours = this will give per hour estimate
<p></li> - Q. How do you classify the severity of the OSA ?
</li><li>Mild- AHI/RDI - 5-14
</li><li>Moderate- AHI/RDI- 15-30
</li><li>Severe- AHI/RDI >30 
<p></li> - Q. What are the consequences and complications of OSA ?
</li><li>1. Motor vehicle accidents
</li><li>2. Neuropsychiatric dysfunction
</li><li>3. Increased risk of cardiovascular disease
</li><li>4. Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure
</li><li>5. Metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes 
</li><li>6.  NASH/NAFLD 
<p></li> - Q. Give the epidemiological link between OSA and DM ? </p><li>
</li><li>40% of OSA patients develop diabetes
</li><li>23% of diabetes patients have have OSA 
</li><li>58% of diabetes patients have some form of sleep-disordered breathing
<p></li> - Q. How common is  obstructive sleep apnea OSA  in the general population ?
</li><li>15-30% of Adult males
</li><li>5-15% of Adult females 
<p></li> - Q. What studies show evidence of a link between OSA and Diabetes ? </p><li>
</li><li>Sleep health heart study- SHHS
</li><li>Wisconsin sleep study 

<p></li> - Q. Is the duration of sleep associated with risk of diabetes ? </p><li>
</li><li>Both short (< 6 hours) and long duration (>8-9 hours) of sleep is associated with increase risk of diabetes 
</li><li>EPIC study showed this link
</li><li>However the risk is attenuated after the obesity is taken into consideration  
<p></li> - Q. What is the role of melatonin in this ? </p><li>
</li><li>A new theory suggests that disturbed sleep reduces melatonin and reduced melatonin is associated with an increased risk of diabetes 
<p></li> - Q. What is the link between OSA and Cardiovascular disease  ? </p><li>
</li><li>OSA leads to
    </li><li>Increase risk of hypertension
    </li><li>Increase CV mortality – due to arrhythmia 
<p></li> - Q. What is the impact of correction/treatment of OSA on Diabetes and CV risk ? </p><li>
</li><li>Impact of OSA treatment on Glycemic control- mixed results
</li><li>Impact of OSA treatment on Cardiovascular disease – reduced CV mortality is well known
<p></li> - Q. What are options for management of OSA ? </p><li>
</li><li>Lifestyle measures
</li><li>Oral appliance
</li><li>Positive airway therapy
</li><li>Surgery 
<p></li> - Q. Is sleep position important ?
</li><li>Some patients have positional OSA
</li><li>This has to be confirmed on  Polysomnography 
</li><li>If these patients do have positional OSA, in such cases you can consider asking them to sleep in non-supine position which reduces the OSA
<p></li> - Q. Positive airway pressure therapy is recommended for which patients with OSA?
</li><li>It is recommended for patients with AHI/RDI >30
</li><li>For mild to moderate OSA - oral appliance versus CPAP may be chosen
<p></li> - Q. What are the modes of delivering positive airway therapy ?
</li><li>1. CPAP- continuous 
</li><li>2. BiPAP- bi-level 
</li><li>3. APAP- autotitrating 
</li><li>4. Adapting seroventilation 
<p></li> - Q. What are the different types of oral appliances available for OSA ?
</li><li>1. Mandibular advancement splints
    </li><li>
    </li><li>
</li><li>2. Tongue-retaining devices
    </li><li>These devices pull the tongue out of the mouth to allow to increase retrolingual space 
    </li><li>
<p></li> - Q. What is a mandibular advancement splint ?
</li><li>They are device anchored to the teeth and cause advancement of the lower jaw.
</li><li>This produces anteroposterior and lateral retrolingual and retropalatal enlargement
   
<p></li> - Q. When is surgery performed ?
</li><li>It is generally done when there are large anatomical abnormalities of the upper airway
</li><li>this include:
    </li><li>Tonsillar hypertrophy
    </li><li>Adenoid hypertrophy
    </li><li>Craniofacial abnormalities
<p></li> - Q. What is hypoglossal nerve stimulation?
</li><li>this is a surgical approach tried in some selected patients
</li><li>there is a implanted neurostimulator that stimulates the hypoglossal nerve
<p></li> - Q. What is the role of pharmacological therapy ?
</li><li>Some medications like Theophylline, Desipramine etc have been tried- but effect is not very encouraging
</li><li>A cannabinoid agent, dronabinol has been tested, but currently it is not recommended by the society
<p></li> - Q. What is done for patients having persistent daytime sleepiness even after correcting with other means ?
</li><li>Modafinil may be used in such patients </li>
