## FAQs on Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

### Q. What are the components of Sleep-Disordered Breathing?
- Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)  
- Central Sleep Apnea  
- Periodic Breathing  

### Q. What are reasons for sleep disturbances in patients with diabetes?
- OSA-associated obesity  
- Other types of sleep-disordered breathing  
- Diabetic autonomic neuropathy  
- Nocturia/polyuria  
- Restless leg syndrome  
- Hypoglycemia-induced sympathetic stimulation  

### Q. What is the definition of OSA?
- "OSA is a disorder characterized by obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and/or respiratory effort-related arousals caused by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep."  
- Daytime somnolence with ≥5 episodes of obstructive breathing per hour during sleep:  
  - **Apnea**: Cessation of airflow for ≥10 seconds.  
  - **Hypopnea**: ≥50% reduction in airflow for ≥10 seconds.  

### Q. What is the classical triad of OSA?
- Daytime somnolence  
- Snoring  
- Witnessed apnea during sleep  

### Q. What are the symptoms of OSA?
- Daytime sleepiness  
- Nonrestorative sleep  
- Loud snoring  
- Witnessed apneas by a bed partner  
- Awakening with choking or gasping  
- Insomnia with frequent awakenings  
- Morning headaches  
- Nocturia  
- Cognitive and mood changes  

### Q. Can insomnia be a symptom of OSA?
- Yes. 1/3rd of patients, especially females, report insomnia rather than daytime sleepiness (sleep maintenance insomnia).

### Q. What are the well-defined risk factors for OSA?
1. Old age  
2. Male gender  
3. Obesity  
4. Craniofacial abnormalities  
5. Upper airway abnormalities  
6. Family history, smoking, and nasal congestion  

### Q. What clinical examination findings suggest OSA?
- Narrow or crowded airway  
- Obesity  
- Large neck circumference (>17 inches)  
- Craniofacial abnormalities (e.g., retrognathia)  

### Q. What medical conditions exacerbate the risk of OSA?
- Type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, PCOS, acromegaly, pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, CHF, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic lung disease, stroke  

### Q. What questionnaires are used to screen for OSA?
- **Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)**: Score >9 prompts further investigation.  
- Berlin Questionnaire  
- STOP-BANG Questionnaire  

### Q. What is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA?
- Polysomnography (PSG).  

### Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for OSA based on PSG?
- **Asymptomatic**: ≥15 episodes of apnea, hypopnea, or RERA/hour.  
- **Symptomatic**: ≥5 episodes/hour with associated symptoms like sleepiness, snoring, fatigue, or hypertension.  

### Q. What is the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)?
- **Formula**: (Apneas + Hypopneas) ÷ Total sleep duration (hours).  

### Q. How is OSA severity classified?
- **Mild**: AHI/RDI 5–14  
- **Moderate**: AHI/RDI 15–30  
- **Severe**: AHI/RDI >30  

### Q. What are the consequences and complications of OSA?
1. Motor vehicle accidents  
2. Neuropsychiatric dysfunction  
3. Cardiovascular disease  
4. Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure  
5. Metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes  

### Q. What is the epidemiological link between OSA and diabetes?
- 40% of OSA patients develop diabetes.  
- 58% of diabetes patients have sleep-disordered breathing.  

### Q. What studies show evidence of a link between OSA and diabetes?
- Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)  
- Wisconsin Sleep Study  

### Q. What are options for managing OSA?
1. Lifestyle changes  
2. Oral appliances  
3. Positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP/BiPAP/APAP)  
4. Surgery for anatomical abnormalities  

### Q. What is hypoglossal nerve stimulation?
- A surgical technique using an implanted neurostimulator to stimulate the hypoglossal nerve.  

### Q. When is pharmacological therapy used for OSA?
- Limited role; drugs like theophylline and cannabinoids have been tested but are not widely recommended.  

### Q. What is done for persistent daytime sleepiness despite treatment?
- Modafinil may be considered.  

### Q. What are the modes of delivering positive airway therapy?
1. CPAP (Continuous)  
2. BiPAP (Bi-level)  
3. APAP (Auto-titrating)  
4. Adaptive servo-ventilation  

### Pearl:
- **Unexplained pulmonary hypertension** may indicate OSA.
