- Q. Summarize the  Pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes  and its  natural history  with a picture ?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FqNGiWvxik0.41.34%402x.png?alt=media&token=64b8bd31-5cd0-49d4-94a2-278cc9e8d7db)

- Q. How many  islets of langerhans  do we have and how many  Beta-cells  in each of them ?
    - We have 1 million  islets of langerhans 
    - Each islet has 1000  Beta-cells 

- Q. What % of  Beta-cells  function is lost at the time of diagnosis of  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus  and what % is lost every year ?
    - 50% is lost at the time of diagnosis
    - 4-5% reduction every year

- Q. What does insulin output depend upon ?
    - It depends upon 
        - 1.  beta-cell mass 
        - 2.  beta-cell function 

- Q. What is the current debate in the role of  Beta-cells  in Type 2 diabetes ?
    -  The current debate is whether is there a reduction in beta-cell mass that leads to type 2 diabetes or it is reduction in beta-cell function that leads to diabetes 

- Q. Why is this debate important ?
    - This is important because if there is only loss of function and not mass to potential of remission from disease is high 
    - However, if there is a loss of mass and less issue with function- the potential of remission over a long term is questionable 

- Q. What are Swisa's three models for  Beta-cell failure  in  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus  ?
    - 1. Reduced beta-cell number
    - 2.  Beta-cell dysfunction  due to (Also called  beta-cell exhaustion )
        -  Endoplasmic reticulum stress 
        -  Oxidative stress 
    - 3. Compromised identity of  Beta-cells  
        - or Dedifferentiation / transdifferentiation of beta-cells

- Q. First model - What leads to reduction of reduced  beta-cell mass  ?
    - 1. People may have low beta-cell to begin with (Fetal programming)
    - 2. Beta-cell may undergo  apoptosis 
    - 3. Aging leads to decline in beta-cell mass

- Q. Second model - What leads to reduced  beta-cell function  ?
    - 1.  Endoplasmic reticulum stress 
        -  Endoplasmic reticulum stress  is an important cause of beta-cell loss in both type 1 and  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus  
    - 2.  Oxidative stress 
    - This is where the phenomenon of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  comes into picture
    - This is the recoverable part of  Beta-cell dysfunction 
    - There might be temporary stunning of beta-cells due to  Hyperglycemia 

- Q. ER Stress and Beta-cells

- Q. Third model - compromised identity - Transdiffertiation of Beta-cells to other cells
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FNcVu76mg2c.28.17%402x.png?alt=media&token=92548285-9ca4-4429-89a8-9c52bf9fac04)

- Q.  Of the above two models - which is more important ? 
    - Model 2 is more important
    - This is because reduction of beta-cell mass can be compensated by increase in  beta-cell function 
    - A patient can have diabetes even with normal  beta-cell mass 
    - On the contrary- increase of  beta-cell mass  may not always compensate for reduced  beta-cell function 
    - This is a very important thing to understand

- Q. According to a study, which drugs lead to how much of monotherapy failure?
    - At 5 years
        - Glyburide- 34%
        - Metformin- 21%
        - Rosiglitazone- 15%

- Q. Enlist the various tests that are useful for the  Assessment of beta-cell function  ( beta-cell function ) in clinical practice ?
    - 1.  Proinsulin:Insulin ratio 
    - 2.  HOMA-Beta 
    - 3.  Mixed meal stimulation test 
    - 4.  OGTT 

- Q. What are the usual  C-peptide  in Fasting and post-meal states in euglycemic individual ?
    - Fasting - 0.9-1.8 ng/ml
    - Post -meal- 3-9 ng/ml

- Q. What is the best-cutt of blood  C-peptide  levels to determine insulin use in a post-prandial sample ?
    - 2 hour post meal- C-peptide  <6 ng/dl (<2.02 nmol/l) is a stong predictor of insulin requirement 

- Q. What is the interpretation of Random C-peptide value ?
    - The RBS >140 mg/dl for interpretation
    - Random c-peptide 
        - <0.6 ng/ml ==> Absolute insulin deficiency
        - <1.8 ng/ml ==> Likely Type 1 
        - 0.6-6.0 ng/ml ==> Requires mixed meal stimulation test 
        - More than 6.0 ng/ml==> Rules out Type 1

    - Convert nmol/l to ng/dl by multiplying by 3
