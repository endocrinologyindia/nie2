- ** Quantification of insulin resistance**


- Q. Summarize the various methods for measurement of Insulin resistance?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FwDrXQvuFrb.png?alt=media&token=f55f07f1-fa60-4798-8f81-2233334b1445)
    - Indirect methods
        - 1.IV glucose tolerance test
        - 2.Insulin indices- HOMA-IR, McAuley index, QUICKI
        - 3.Clinical – Metabolic syndrome criteria
        - 4.Others- Fasting TG, Fasting Insulin, TG/HDL ratio


- Q. What is the gold standard for the Quantification of insulin resistance?
    - > Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp


- Q. What are the different types of clamp techniques used?
    - Euglycemic clamp (also called Hyperinsulinemic clamp)
        - done to assess Insulin resistance  
        - Here, the glucose level is kept steady 
    - Hyperglycemic clamp 
        - Done to assess beta-cell function 
        - "how much insulin was released in response to hyperglycemia." 
    - Hypoglycemia clamp 
        - used to study counter-regulatory hormones


- Q. Describe the technique of Euglycemic clamp?
    - First insulin infusion is given to block the hepatic gluconeogenesis 
    - Then glucose infusion is given and adjusted to maintain a steady-state of plasma glucose 
    - When hepatic glucose is suppressed, the amount of glucose given from outside to maintain Euglycemia is the amount of glucose that goes to the muscles 
    - Hence if more glucose is needed, then it means more glucose is going to the muscles, which means there is less insulin resistance 
    - If  less glucose needed is needed, it means less glucose is going to muscles, which means more Insulin resistance

- Q. What is the interpretation of GIR values in Euglycemic clamp?
    - Glucose infusion rate 
        - More than 7.5 mg/min – normal
        - 4.0- 7.5 mg/min – variable 
        - Less than 4.0 mg/min – insulin resistance


- Q. Describe the Hyperglycemic clamp?
    - Here, the glucose level is held at a higher rate of 125 mg/dl 
    - Glucose infusion is given to maintain it at this level 
    - This level of blood glucose would lead to endogenous insulin secretion 
    - Now, if endogenous insulin secretion is higher – a higher amount of Glucose infusion rate will be needed to maintain this level of glycemia and vice versa


- Q. Describe the Insulin suppression test (also called the Insulin sensitivity test)?
    - Octreotide given to suppress endogenous insulin production 
    - Now, Insulin infusion and Glucose infusion are given and the dose adjusted to achieve steady-state plasma glucose concentration (SSPG) 
    - Once SSPG is achieved, the higher the SSPG higher the insulin resistance


- Q. What is the insulin tolerance test for Insulin resistance?
    - This is an outdated method
    - After an overnight fast, in an average individual, an intravenous bolus injection of a dose of regular Insulin of 0.1 U/kg of body weight will reduce the blood glucose level to a value of 50% or less of the initial value or may provoke frank hypoglycemia. 
    - A patient with peripheral insulin resistance will require a higher dose of injected Insulin (≤0.2 U/kg) to produce this reduction in the fasting glucose level. 
    - If the patient requires an insulin bolus of 0.3 U/kg or more to induce hypoglycemia, the diagnosis of extreme insulin resistance is certain. 
    - Given the importance of the diagnosis, a serum insulin level should be obtained 10 minutes after insulin injection to confirm that Insulin entered the vascular compartment. 


- **Indirect methods**


- Q. What are indices used in clinical practice for non-diabetic individuals?
    - Triglyceride - >130 mg/dl 
    - TG / HDL ratio >3.0 
    - Fasting insulin >15.7 uU/ml 
    - Insulin indices
        - HOMA-IR
        - QUICKI
        - McAuley index 
    - Using the diagnostic criteria for Metabolic syndrome 


- Q. Is there any importance of fasting and postprandial insulin levels ? (in euglycemic patients)
    - This is now outdated
    - Some textbooks say the following is high 
        - Fasting insulin >30 uU/ml 
        - Postprandial >200 mU/ml 


- Q. What dose of Insulin suggests insulin resistance?
    - A normal person secretes 25-40 units of Insulin a day which is 0.3-0.5 units/kg 
    - Any person requiring >1.5-2 units/kg/day of Insulin (>60-100 units /day) should be evaluated for insulin resistance


- Q. How is HOMA IR calculated?
    - Fasting insulin (in mIU/ml) x Glucose (mmol/) / 22.5 
    - Fasting insulin (in mIU/ml) x glucose (mg/dl) / 405


- Q. What is the cutoff for HOMA IR?
    - Prepuberty (SMR I) = >2.5 
    - Pubertal children and adults (SMR II or higher) > 4.0


- Q. What is fullform of QUICKI ?
    - Quantitative Insulin sensitivity check index


- Q. What is the formula for QUICKI?
    - 1 / log(insulin in mIU/l) + log (glucose mg/dl)


- Q. What is the cutoff for QUICKI?
    - QUICKI index ranges from 0.45 in healthy individuals to 0.30 in people with diabetes;
    - Lower values indicate greater insulin resistance
    - Values below 0.339  in adults indicate insulin resistance


- Q. How is the McAuley index calculated, and what are its cut-offs?
    - It is based on TG and Insulin McAuley index =

    - (e = exponential, ln = log , TAG = triglyceride)
    - Value > 9.8 is considered to be high


- Q. Summarize the normal and abnormal values of various indices?
