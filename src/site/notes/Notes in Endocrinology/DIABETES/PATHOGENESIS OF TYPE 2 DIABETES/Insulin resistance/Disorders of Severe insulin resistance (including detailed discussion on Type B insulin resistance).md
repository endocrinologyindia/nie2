- Q. Enlist the various disorder associated with severe insulin resistance.
    - Defect in insulin receptor gene
        - Leperchunism- most severe
        - Rabson Mendenhall syndrome – Moderate
        - Type A IR syndrome – mildest- HAIR- AN syndrome
    - 2. Antibodies against insulin receptor
        - Type B insulin receptor syndrome
        - Ataxia telegectasia
- 3. Lipodystrophic syndromes 
    - Congenital generalized Lipodystrophy – Bernerdenelli Seip syndrome
    - Familial partial lipodystrophy – Donnigan syndrome, Koberling syndrome
    - Acquired generalized lipodystrophy- Lawrence syndrome
    - Acquired partial lipodystrophy- Barraqurer- Simmons syndrome
    - HIV lipodystrophy
- **Leperchaunism **
- Q. What is the other name of this syndrome?
    - Donohue syndrome
- Q. What is the main defect in this disorder?
    - There is a defect in the gene coding for insulin receptor
    - Hence these patients have an absence of insulin receptor – INSR gene
- Q. What are the clinical features?
    - Short stature
    - Severe insulin resistance
    - Fasting Hypoglycemia and post-prandial hyperglycemia
    - Growth retardation starting from intrauterine life
    - Autosomal recessive
    - Death by 1 year of age
    - A very rare disorder
- Q. What is the treatment?
    - IGF1
- **Rabson mendenhall syndrome **
- Q. Tell me something about this syndrome.
    - It is similar to Leperchaunism but milder
    - They survive till adolescence
- Q. What are the Clinical features of this syndrome?
    - Diabetes by 5-6 years requiring high dose of insulin
    - Coarse senile facies
    - Dysplastic dentition
    - Pineal gland hyperplasia
- **Type A insulin resistance syndrome **
- Q. What is Type A insulin resistance syndrome?
    - This is a mutation in the insulin receptor 
    - Patients generally present in adolescence with features of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism
- Q. What is the other name of this syndrome?
    - This is the one called HAIR-AN syndrome
        - H- hyperandrogenism
        - Insulin resistance
        - Acanthosis nigricans
    - Pearl
    - Insulin receptor disorder
        - Mildest- Type A IR syndrome
        - Moderate- Rabson Mendenhall syndrome
        - Severe – Leperchaunism

- **Type B insulin resistance syndrome **
- Q. What is the pathogenesis of this syndrome?
    - This is due to antibodies against insulin receptors- this is called AIRA - anti-insulin receptor antibody 
- Q. What are the clinical features of this syndrome?
    - Typically present in middle age females
    - May have associated with other autoimmune disorders
- Q. Will this always lead to hyperglycemia?
    - No
    - It can lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia depending on whether the antibody is activating or blocking
- Q. Of the two, which presentation is more common?
    - Hyperglycemia is more common than hypoglycemia 
- Q. Which other syndrome is associated with antibodies against insulin receptors?
    - Ataxia telegectasia
- Q. What is the typical age of presentation?
    - 30-50 years 
- Q. Is it associated with other autoimmune diseases?
    - Yes
    - Has been reported with SLE and other autoimmune disorders
- Q. When is the antibody stimulatory and when is it blocking?
    - At low titers the antibody tends to be stimulatory - leading to hypoglycemia
    - In high titers, it tends to be blocking- leading to hyperglycemia
- Q. Does it follow a consistent pattern?
    - No 
    - It waxes and wanes
    - Sometimes the antibody disappears leading to periods of euglycemia 
- Q. What is the characteristic biochemical signature of this disorder?
    - They have insulin resistance but Triglyceride is NOT elevated
    - This is the sin-quo-non of this condition 
- Q. Apart from this what are the other markers of this condition?
    - Fasting insulin levels >20 mIU/l
    - Lean patient requiring >3 units/kg/day
- Q. Is the antibody available commercially?
    - No
    - It is done only in selected research labs
- Q. What are the clinical features?
    - 1. Weight loss is typical
        - They are severely catabolic during the hyperglycemic phase
    - 2. Acanthosis nigricans
        - which improves with improvement in the disease state
    - 3. Hyperandrogenism
- Q. When do they develop hypoglycemia?
    - So they have a hypoglycemic phase and a hyperglycemic phase
    - During the hyperglycemic phase- they need massive amounts of insulin- but they don't develop hypoglycemia because of that
    - Hypoglycemia develops when the hyperglycemia phase resolves and it is often spontaneous
    - So basically these two states are often separate- and though they can both exist in the same person- they exist at different times
    - Hypoglycemia can be severe enough to cause mortality 
- Q. What are the aspects of managing this disorder?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FJKEPrxhcyM.png?alt=media&token=2da68ad5-6cee-4ab3-a23f-4c3739525042)
- Q. How is the hyperglycemia phase managed?
    - U500 or other concentrated insulin is the treatment of choice
    - Try to target normal fasting glucose levels
    - OAD doesn't seem to work 
    - Please note- achieving fasting glucose in a normal range is a sign of reducing antibodies- in this stage, they can have partial agonist action of antibodies - this can lead to hypoglycemia in the future hence it is a good time to reduce insulin doses
    - IGF-1 is found to be useful for correcting hyperglycemia in anecdotal reports
- Q. How is hypoglycemia treated?
    - With glucocorticoids 
- Q. What immunomodulation therapy is recommended?
    - A combination of Rituximab + high dose pulse glucocorticoids + cyclophosphamide is found to be effective 
    - Azathioprine is given during the maintenance phase 
    - Be careful when giving immunomodulation during the hyperglycemia phase- because it can reduce antibodies which can make it stimulating and produce hypoglycemia- this can be fatal
