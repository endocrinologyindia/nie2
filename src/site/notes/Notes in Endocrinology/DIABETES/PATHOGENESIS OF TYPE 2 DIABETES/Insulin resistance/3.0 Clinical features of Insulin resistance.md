        - Type 2 diabetes 
    - Musculoskeletal 
        - Pseudoacromegaly
        - Muscles cramps
        - Muscle hypertrophy 
    - Cutaneous 
        - Acanthosis nigricans
        - Skin tags
        - Hirsutism 
        - Alopecia 
    - Reproductive
        - Oligo-amenorrhea
        - infertility and Anovulation 
        - Hirsutism 
        - Virilization 
        - PCOS 
    - Adipose tissue
        - Central adiposity
        - Lipodystrophy â€“ lipoatrophy or hypertrophy 
        - Lipid metabolism 
        - Hypertriglyceridemia 
    - Growth 
        - Normal, Impaired or accelerated 
        - Pseudoacromegaly 
    - Autoimmunity 
        - Type B insulin resistance syndrome 
    - Metabolic syndrome 


- Q. What is the reason for excess growth in Insulin resistance syndrome? 
    - Excess insulin has a "specificity spillover" on IGF1 receptor leading to increased growth and pseudoacromegaly like features


- Q. Can IR be associated with hypoglycemia? 
    - Yes
    - In those having anti-insulin antibodies 


- Q. What are the 3 characteristic histological features of Acanthosis nigricans? 
    - Papillomatosis
    - Hyperkeratosis
    - Increase melanocytes 


- Q. How does excess insulin produce ovarian hyperandrogenism? 
    - Ovarian theca cells have insulin and IGF1 receptors which are activated, hence theca cells produce more androgen 


- Q. Which conditions lead to growth retardation and insulin resistance? 
    - Leprechaunism
    - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome 


- Q. Which insulin resistance syndrome is autoimmune? 
    - Type B insulin resistance syndrome 

-   Q. What are the differential impacts of insulin resistance at various organs of the body ?
