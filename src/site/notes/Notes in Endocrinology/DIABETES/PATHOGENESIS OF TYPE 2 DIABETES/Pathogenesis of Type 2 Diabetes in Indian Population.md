- Q.  What are the three key features of type 2 diabetes in Indian and Chinese populations?
    - 1. Younger age at diagnosis
    - 2. More beta-cell failure
    - 3. Leaner body habitus


- Q. What pathophysiological feature is seen in first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes that determines that there is probably a genetic component to diabetes?
    - Relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes have impaired first-phase and second-phase insulin secretion compared to other normal population
    - this may predispose them to develop type 2 diabetes in future


- Q. What is the key pathophysiological driver in patients with type 2 diabetes of South Asian origin and what studies have validated this?
    - The British Whitehall study, the MASALA, and the MESA studies looked at the pathophysiological differences in South Asians versus Europeans
    - They found that the HOMA-S was lower in South Asians compared to Europeans but in both cases declined with age
    - The HOMA-Beta- representing insulin response peaked 15 years earlier in South Asians and declined earlier compared to Europeans suggesting early exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms in South Asians compared to the Caucasians
    - This tells us that Beta-cell dysfunction occurs earlier in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes compared to Europeans


- Q. Apart from HOMA-Beta, what are the other methods by which you can determine the decline in beta-cell function over a period of time?
    - 1. [[Oral disposition index\|Oral disposition index]] 
    - 2. Glycemic deterioration over time - as evidenced by slipe of HbA1c over time 


- Q.  What is the formulation for [[Oral disposition index\|Oral disposition index]]?
    - Oral disposition index = Insulin sensitivity index (Matsuda index) x insulin secretion index 
        - Insulin sensitivity index = ISI = 10,000/square root of (Insulin at fasting × Glucose at fasting) × (mean glucose × mean insulin during OGTT) ==> note 75-g oral glucose test is used and blood samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min for the measurement of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations
        - Insulin secreation index = ΔI30/ΔG30 = (Ins30-Ins0)/(Glu30-Glu0)
            - Insulin and glucose at 30 minutes and baseline


- Q. In Indian patients with prediabetes- is there more IFG or more IGT?
    - There is more IFG compared to IGT
    - This is similar to non-caucasian cohorts in the US
    - The increase in IFG represents hepatic insulin resistance 
    - HOMA-IR correlates well with hepatic insulin resistance


- Q. What is the distinct difference in the insulin resistance patterns in Indian versus the Chinese?
    - The Chinese have more Skeletal muscle insulin resistance and Indians have more hepatic insulin resistance
    - Hence Chinese Pre-diabetics have more IGT while Indians have more IFG

- Q. Summarize the key points in pathogenesis of [[Type 2 Diabetes mellitus\|Type 2 Diabetes mellitus]] in Indians

- Q. Which are the distinct alleles found from the GWAS study in the UK biobank in the Indian population that predispose them to develop Type 2 Diabetes?
    - HNF4A - Deals with insulin secretion
    - GRB14- deals with the action of insulin receptor
    - ST6GAL1- deals with insulin action
    - TMEM163- associated with insulin secretion 


- Q. What are the broad interpretations from the UK biobank studies?
    - 1. Indians tend to have more issues with insulin secretion 
    - 2. The alleles for subcutaneous adiposity are missing- hence Indians tend to have visceral adiposity 


- Q. What are the common histopathological feature that is seen in Indian and Chinese type 2 diabetes patients?
    - Islet amyloid deposits in the pancreas are common in Indian and Chinese populations
    - They are seen in 40-100% of the patients


- Q. Summarize the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of Type 2 Diabetes in the Indian and the Chinese?

- Q. What is the ANDIS classification of Diabetes mellitus?
    - Tags: [[Diabetes classification\|Diabetes classification]]; [[Swedish cluster\|Swedish cluster]]; [[Subtype of Diabetes\|Subtype of Diabetes]]; [[ANDIS classification\|ANDIS classification]]
    - This is the classification of diabetes from the Swedish Cluster
    - SAID = Severe Autoimmune Diabetes
        - GAD antibodies, low insulin secretion, poor metabolic control
    - SIDD = Severe Insulin Deficient Diabetes
        - Low insulin secretion, poor metabolic control, increased risk of retinopathy
    - SIRD = Severe Insulin Resistant Diabetes
        - Insulin resistance, obesity, late-onset, marked increased risk of nephropathy
    - MOD = Moderate Obesity-Related Diabetes
        - Obesity, early-onset, good metabolic control
    - MARD = Moderate Age-Related Diabetes
        - Late-onset, good metabolic control, low risk of complications


- Q. What is the frequency of these clusters in the Indian cohorts?
    - The data from this comes from the INSPIRED and INDIAB studies
    - The frequencies are as follows:
    - 1. Severe insulin-deficient diabetes- 26-27%
    - 2. Severe insulin-resistant diabetes-7-12%
    - 3. Moderate obesity-related diabetes- 25-30%
    - 4. Mild age-related diabetes- 34-35%


- Q. What were the features of the [[Severe insulin-deficient diabetes cluster\|Severe insulin-deficient diabetes cluster]] in the Indian population?
    - 1. It was more often compared to the Swedish (26% vs 17%)
    - 2. At younger age (42 vs 57 years)
    - 3. Lower BMI
    - 4. Lower beta-cell function
    - 5. lower insulin resistance
    - Interestingly even the severe insulin-resistant cluster of Indian patients had lower HOMA-Beta values (meaning more beta-cell dysfunction) compared to the  Swedish cohort


- Q. Is the beta-cell decline in Young diabetics faster compared to others?
    - Yes
    - Type 2 diabetes before age of 40 years as studied in the TODAY trial showed more rapid deterioration of beta-cell function
    - this was evidenced by a rapidly declining oral disposition index at rate of 20-30% per year 


- Q. Why are [[DPP-4 inhibitors\|DPP-4 inhibitors]] more effective in the Indian population?
    - they say that it restores [[First phase insulin secreation\|First phase insulin secreation]] earlier
    - hence more effective 


- Q. What are the special issues with Thiazolidinones in the Asian population?
    - It seems that in the Asian population- the increased risk for heart failure hospitalization is not seen with these class of drugs 
    - Tags: [[Pioglitazone\|Pioglitazone]]


- Q. What are the summary and conclusion of this article?
    - 1. The age of onset of diabetes in the Indian population may be younger compared to the west. Diabetes before 40 years of age is very common
    - 2. Indian cohorts tend to have lower beta-cell function compared to the western cohorts. This is the key pathophysiological point and must be always kept in mind
    - 3. Severe insulin-deficient diabetes is a common cluster in the Indian subset of patients
    - 4. Overall, Indian diabetes is leaner and subcutaneous fat deposition is lesser
    - 5. Incretin-based therapies and AGI tend to do very well in the Indian subset of patients, especially when initiated when beta-cells are well preserved
