- Q. Who was the first to give the concept of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  ?
    - Rosetti and Defronzo


- Q. In current sense what is applicable to  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  ?
    - In this chapter it refers to excess glucose altering the mechanism of glucose itself
    - Basically it is high glucose producing Insulin resistance


- Q. What is the mass action of glucose ?
    - This concept if the key to understanding  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  
    - What is means is, that in presence of insulin, an increased level of glucose increases its own uptake and utilization 
    - This is dependent for insulin dependent tissues and not for the tissues like brain
    - This is normal physiology in non-diabetic individuals
    - However, in diabetic individuals, the insulin production is reduced
    - Hence in such patients the glucose will increase and this hyperglycemia ideally would lead to increase glucose utilization overhwhealming the patient
    - This does not happen because of a protective mechanism which the body hass
    - In such scenario, the body increases the Insulin resistance leading to normalization of glucose utilization in insulin dependent tissues 
    - So the insulin dependent tissues are spared of the effect of the hyperglycemia, but what about the non-insulin dependent tissues ?
        - Now this WILL be affected
        - The affect is however, restricted to tissues not protected by blood brain barrier - ie the brain again is spared
        - Which are these tissues ?  The big three- kidney, retina and peripheral nerves ! 
 
- Q. What kind of Insulin resistance is seen in patients with Type 1 Diabetes ?
    - Insulin resistance is mainly seen at the skeletal muscles  peripheral insulin resistance
    - It is believed most of the insulin resistance in this case is attributable to  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity) 


- Q. Does Chronic hyperglycemia itself cause Diabetes mellitus ?
    - Yes
    - This would be a consequence of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity) 
    - Classical studies done in cats by Lukens and Dohan have shown that chronic hyperglycemia was responsible for causing permenent type 2 diabetes in these cats
    - Chronic hyperglyemia not only increases insulin resistance but also impairs beta-cell responsiveness to glucose 
    - Studies have shown that hyperglycemia exposure to >68 hours leads to significant reduction of insulin secreation 
    - > Interestingly in most of the animal studies, use of phlorizin has been shown to restore the action- is there are role of SGLT2i in removing the  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  ? 


- WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED SO FAR  #Conceptual-Learning 
    - Glucose toxicity is basically hyperglycemia reducing the body's ability to clear the hyperglycemia- hyperglycemia begetting hyperglycemia 
    - Acute/Subacute hyperglycemia like in Type 1 Diabetes can cause peripheral insulin resistance
    - Chronic hyperglycemia - reduces beta-cell responsiveness to glucose-mediated insulin secretion


- Q. What are the potential mechanisms for  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  ?
    - 1. Extra glucose -→ converted to Lipid -→ Lipid flux produces Insulin resistance
    - 2. Increase Reactive oxygen species
    - 3. Increase flux through hexosamine linked glycation pathway 


- Q. What is the importance of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine ?
    - This is a intermediate which is an important nutrient sensor
    - All the glucose and other nutrients are converted to UDP-N-Acetylgluosamine via the hexosamine pathway


- Q. What is the link between Oxidative stress and Beta-cells damage ?
    - Increased oxidative stress leads to Beta-cell dysfunction and damage
    - Remember oxidative stress also increases Insulin resistance


- Q. So in case of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity) , is the response to other nutrients preserved ?
    - This is the interesting part
    - In case of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity) , there is a loss of beta-cell response to glucose.
    - However, the beta-cell response to other nutrients which stimulate insulin release like Arginine is preserved and sometimes even exaggarated


- Q. What is the best example of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  in Type 1 Diabetes ?
    - The "honeymoon period" in Type 1 Diabetes 


- Q. How common is the honeymoon period ?
    - It is seen in almost 30% of patients with Type 1 Diabetes


- Q. What is an example of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  in Type 2 Diabetes ?
    - The improvement in glycemic control and partial remission in Type 2 Diabetes  because of Short term intensive insulin therapy is an example of  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  in type 2 diabetes


- #Clinicalpearl
    -  Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)  leads to insulin resistance in both type 1 as well as type 2 diabetes which can be reversed with good glycemic control
