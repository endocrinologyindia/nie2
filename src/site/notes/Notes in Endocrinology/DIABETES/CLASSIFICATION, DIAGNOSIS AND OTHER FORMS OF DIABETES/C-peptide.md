- Q. What is [[Notes in Endocrinology/DIABETES/CLASSIFICATION, DIAGNOSIS AND OTHER FORMS OF DIABETES/C-peptide\|C-peptide]] ?
    - The pancreatic proinsulin is broken down into insulin and [[Notes in Endocrinology/DIABETES/CLASSIFICATION, DIAGNOSIS AND OTHER FORMS OF DIABETES/C-peptide\|C-peptide]]
    - The C-peptide is released in equimolar concentration as insulin


- Q. What are the various ways in which C-peptide is measured ?
    - C peptide measurement in blood
        - Fasting
        - Stimulated 
        - Random C peptide
    - Urine C peptide can also be measured – requires 24 hr collection


- Q. Of the above, which is a good marker of Beta-cell reserve ?
    - Stimulated C peptide is a marker of Beta cell reserve


- Q. What are the methods for "stimulation" in C-peptide ?
    - Glucose load
    - Mixed meal
    - Glucagon


- Q. Broadly, what is the difference between C-peptide in type 1 and type 2 diabetes in terms of stimulation test ? 
    - Type 1 there is little or no increase in C peptide over baseline
    - Type 2 there is some increase in C peptide over baseline


- Q. What basal c-peptide value helps discriminate type 1 from type 2 diabetes ? 
    - About 80% of Basal C-peptide levels below a cutoff of 0.6 ng/ml (0.2 nmol/l) have type 1 diabetes 
    - Similarly 80% of patients with stimulated C-peptide <1 nmol/l have type 1 diabetes


- Q. Is Random C-peptide useful ? 
    - One study showed that random C peptide was better than fasting and stimulated C peptide for classification of diabetes mellitus

- Q. What is the interpretation of non-fasting Random c-peptide value ?

- <0.6 ng/ml - Strongly suggestive of absolute insulin deficiency and type 1 diabetes
- <1.8 ng/ml- Unlikely to achieve glycemic control without the use of Multiple insulin doses 
- More than 3 ng/ml- Unlikely to be type 1 diabetes- more likely to be Type 2 or MODY


- Q. Describe the protocol for Glucagon stimulated C-peptide 
    - Draw baseline fasting specimen. (12 hour of overnight fast) 
    - Administer 1 mg Glucagon I.V. 
    - Draw additional specimens at 6 and 10 minutes post-glucagon 


- Q. What is the protocol for mixed-meal stimulation test ?
    - 1. Fasting - Measure FBS and C-peptide
    - 2. Give liquid mixed meal - Sustacal or Ensure Plus powder  - 6 scoops in 200 ml water
    - 3. Measure RBS and C-peptide 90 min after liquid meals


- Q. What is Sustacal ?
    - It is basically a protein supplement from Nestle 
    - ENSURE PLUS powder can be used as a substitute which has similar composition

- Q. In terms of percentage what is the percentage of C-peptide elevation post-baseline 
    - Normal stimulation of c-peptide is a 150-300% elevation over basal levels.



- Q. Give the scoring of C-peptide post mixed meal stimulation used by Department of Endocrinology at Zydus hospital ? (Unpublished)


	
	- ![Pasted image 20210509174843.png](/img/user/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210509174843.png)
	
    - Total score 
        - ≥5 - stongly suggestive of Type 1 diabetes
        - 3-5- Suggestive of type 1
        - 0-3- Unlikely to be type 1 but close follow-up is required
        - 0 - not type 1 

- Q. In a patient with type 2 diabetes, what value of C-peptide suggest the need for basal-bolus insulin (Multiple dose insulin) for diabetes management as compared to basal insulin with OAD ?
	- Post-stimulation C-peptide <3.1 ng/ml - suggestive of need for MDI therapy instead of basal only

- Q. What cut-off is suggestive of Insulin mediated hypoglycemia in patients undergoing [[72 hour fast test\|72 hour fast test]] for hypoglycemia evaluation ?
    - When glucose value is <55 mg/dl- C-peptide value of >0.6 ng/ml is strongly suggestive insulin mediated hypoglycemia
