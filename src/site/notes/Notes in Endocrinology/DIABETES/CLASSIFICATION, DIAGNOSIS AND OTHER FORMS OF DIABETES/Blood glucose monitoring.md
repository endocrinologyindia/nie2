## FAQs on Blood Glucose Testing

### Q. What precautions are taken while drawing plasma blood glucose?
- Collect from an arm different from where the IV line is to avoid contamination with IV fluid.
- Centrifuge and ship on ice or use a fluoride bulb.

### Q. Which is higher – whole glucose values or plasma glucose values?
- Plasma glucose values are higher than whole glucose values by 12-15%.

### Q. What is the difference between venous and arterial blood glucose?
- **Fasting**: Venous and arterial values are the same.  
- **Post-meal**: Venous values are 10% less than arterial.

### Q. What is the SI unit for glucose?
- **Mmol/liter**  
  - To convert to mg/dl: multiply by 18.

### Q. Which are the two major ways in which blood glucose is measured?
1. Glucose oxidase methods (GOD/POD).
2. Enzymatic methods.

### Q. Which of the above is better?
- **Enzymatic methods**: More sensitive and specific.  
- **Glucose oxidase methods**: Cheaper.

### Q. Which is the reference enzymatic method?
- Hexokinase/G6PDH method.

### Q. Which substances in the blood produce errors with GOD/POD?
- Reducing substances: Ascorbic acid, tetracycline, glutathione, bilirubin.

### Q. Describe the enzymatic reaction in the GOD-POD method:
1. **Reaction**:  
   Glucose + O₂ → (Via Glucose oxidase enzyme) → Glucuronic acid + H₂O₂  
2. **Measurement**:  
   H₂O₂ + Reduced dye → H₂O + Oxidized dye (measured electrochemically).

### Q. What type of glucose does Glucose oxidase act upon?
- Acts on beta D-glucose, not alpha D-glucose (specific step in GOD-POD).

### Q. Give the chemical reaction for Hexokinase/G6PDH method:
1. Glucose → (Hexokinase enzyme) → Glucose-6-phosphate + ADP.  
2. Glucose-6-phosphate → (G6PDH enzyme) → 6-phosphogluconate + NADPH + H.  
   - **NADPH**: Measured using fluorescence.

### Q. What method is used in most labs?
- Glucose oxidase method on Beckman Coulter Unicel DXC-800 analyzer.

### Q. What blood glucose values are reported by glucometers compared to laboratories?
- Glucometers: Whole blood glucose values.  
- Laboratories: Plasma glucose values.  
  - **Modern glucometers**: Adjust to plasma glucose values.

### Q. What are the ISO standards for glucometers?
- **Blood glucose <70 mg/dl**: 95% of readings should be within 15 mg/dl.  
- **Blood glucose >70 mg/dl**: Should be within 20%.

### Q. What is the purpose of fluoride bulbs, and what does it inhibit?
- Fluoride inhibits the **enolase enzyme**, preventing glycolysis during transport.

### Q. How long is glucose stable:
- **With fluoride bulb**: 72 hours at room temperature.  
- **Without fluoride**: 8 hours at 25°C or 72 hours at 4°C.

### Q. If heparin is used to separate plasma, what is the difference in values?
- Glucose values are 5% lower.

### Q. Is finger prick glucose arterial or venous?
- It is **arterial**.

### Q. Where is the finger prick done, and why?
- **Lateral aspect** of the fingertip (fewer nerve endings, less pain).

### Q. What is the typical range for blood glucose strips?
- 10–600 mg/dl.

### Q. If glucometer strips are cut in half, does it reduce accuracy?
- No.

### Q. How do glucometers measure glucose?
1. **Reflectance photometry**: Measures light reflected by chromogen.  
2. **Amperometric method**: Measures current generated by glucose oxidase.  
   - **Reflectance photometry** is better.

### Q. How does hematocrit affect glucose values?
- BG >300 mg/dl:  
  - Hematocrit >55%: Lowers BG by 15%.  
  - Hematocrit <35%: Increases BG by 10%.

### Q. Which common glucometers use the GDH-PQQ method?
- **ACCU-CHEK** (Roche), **FreeStyle** (Abbott Diabetes Care).

### Q. Does the ACCU-CHEK in India use GDH-PQQ?
- No, it uses the **Mut Q-GDH** method.

### Interfering Substances with Glucometers (ADA Guidelines 2021):

#### Glucose oxidase monitors:
- **Interfering Substances**: Uric acid, galactose, xylose, acetaminophen, L-DOPA, ascorbic acid.

#### Glucose dehydrogenase monitors:
- **Interfering Substances**: Icodextrin (used in peritoneal dialysis).

### FDA Standards for Blood Glucose Monitors:

#### Home Use:
- 95% readings: Within 15% for usable BG range.
- 99% readings: Within 20% for usable BG range.

#### Hospital Use:
- 95% readings:  
  - Within 12% for BG ≥75 mg/dl.  
  - Within 12 mg/dl for BG <75 mg/dl.  
- 98% readings:  
  - Within 15% for BG ≥75 mg/dl.  
  - Within 15 mg/dl for BG <75 mg/dl.

### Impact of Oxygen Levels:
- **Glucose oxidase glucometers**: Affected by oxygen levels.  
- **Glucose dehydrogenase glucometers**: Not affected.  
  - **Higher oxygen**: False low values.  
  - **Lower oxygen**: False high values (e.g., high altitude, hypoxia).
