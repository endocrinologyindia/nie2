<p>Q. What precautions are taken while drawing plasma blood glucose?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Collect from arm different from where IV line is to avoid contamination with IV fluid
</li><li>Centrifuge and ship in Ice or use fluoride bulb 
</ul><p>Q. Which is higher – whole glucose values or plasma glucose values?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Plasma glucose values are higher than whole glucose values by 12-15%  
</ul><p>Q. What is the difference between venous and arterial blood glucose?</p> <ul> 
</li><li>In fasting – Venous and arterial are the same
</li><li>Post-meal- venous are less than arterial by 10% 
</ul><p>Q. What is the SI unit for glucose?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Mmol/liter 
</li><li>To convert to mg/dl – multiply by 18 
</ul><p>Q. Which are the two major ways in which blood glucose is measured?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Glucose oxidase methods – GOD/POD
</li><li>Enzymatic method  
</ul><p>Q. Which of the above is better?</p> <ul>

</ul><p>Q. Give the chemical reaction for  Hexokinase / G6PDH method?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Glucose  → (hexokinase enzyme) → Glucose-6 phosphate + ADP
</li><li>Glucose – 6 phosphate → (G6PDH enzyme) → 6 phosphogluconate + NADPH + H 
</li><li>NADPH is measured using fluorescence 
</ul><p>Q. What method is used in most labs?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Glucose oxidase method on Beckman Coulter Unicel DXC-800 analyzer
</ul><p>Q. What blood glucose values are reported by glucometers compared to the laboratory?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Glucometers report whole blood glucose values
</li><li>While Labs report plasma glucose
</li><li>However, most modern glucometers now display the glucose value corrected to the plasma glucose value 
</ul><p>Q. What are the ISO standards for glucometers?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Blood glucose <70 mg/dl- 95% of reading should be within 15 mg/dl
</li><li>Blood glucose > 70 mg/dl- should be within 20% 
</ul><p>Q. What is the purpose of fluoride bulbs, and what does it inhibit?</p> <ul>
</li><li>RBC in the blood utilize the glucose for energy by glycolysis
</li><li>Hence the glucose values reduce during transport
</li><li>Hence, fluoride inhibits the enolase enzyme, which prevents the glycolysis during transport 
</ul><p>Q. How long is it stable at room temperature with a fluoride bulb?</p> <ul> 
</li><li>72 hours at room temperature in fluoride bulb 
</ul><p>Q. How long is it stable when serum is separate, and fluoride is not used?</p> <ul>
</li><li>8 hours at 25 degree
</li><li>72 hours at 4 degree 
</ul><p>Q. If heparin is used to separate the plasma- what is the difference in values?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Glucose value is 5% lower if heparin is used 
</ul><p>Q. Is finger prick glucose – arterial or venous?</p> <ul>
</li><li>It is arterial
</ul><p>Q. Which part of the finger is the prick done and why?</p> <ul>
</li><li>Lateral aspect of the fingertip
</li><li>This has fewer nerve endings 
</li><li>Hence it reduces the pain 
</ul><p>Q. What is the typical range for blood glucose strips?</p> <ul>
</li><li>10-600 mg/dl 
</ul><p>Q., if glucometer strips are cut in half, will it reduce its accuracy?</p> <ul>
</li><li>No 
</ul><p>Q. How do the glucometers measure the reading?</p> <ul>
</li><li>They use one of the two methods
    </li><li>Reflectance photometry- a reflection of light by the chromogen product obtained by glucose oxidase method
    </li><li>Amperometric method- measures the electric current generated by the glucose oxidase method 
</li><li>Reflectance photometry is better 
</ul><p>Q. How does hematocrit affect the glucose values?</p> <ul>
</li><li>When BG >300 mg/dl- hematocrit >55% can lower the BG value by 15%, likewise the hematocrit <35 % can increase the BG value by 10% 
</ul><p>Q. What methods for glucose testing are utilized by most glucometer strips?</p>
</li><li>1. Glucose oxidase method
</li><li>2. Hexokinase/G6PDH method (Glucose dehydrogenase-nicotinamide dinucleotide)
</li><li>3. GDH-Flavin adenine dinucleotide
</li><li>4. GDH-PQQ - glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline quinone (GDH-PQQ) glucose test strips
</ul><p>Q. Of these above methods, which one is most likely to give false results due to interference?</p>
</li><li>GDH-PQQ method
</li><li>This method is not specific to glucose 
</li><li>Apart from glucose, it also catalyzes other sugars like maltose, galactose, and xylose
</ul><p>Q. How does  Vitamin C  lead to interference with the glucometer values?</p>
</li><li>Vitamin C mainly produces interference with the GDH-PQQ method
</li><li>This is because vitamin C is an antioxidant 
</li><li>it inactivates free radical and itself if oxidised on the surface of the strip to produce electrons which produce the current by the Amperometric method
</li><li>This produces false high values
</ul><p>Q. Which other common substances can produce similar interferences?</p>
</li><li>Maltose producing substances
</li><li>Icodextrin present in peritoneal fluid (also see  MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES IN PATIENT WITH CKD 
</li><li>Certain immunoglobulins like abatacept, tositumomab, etc
</ul><p>Q. Which common glucometers use the GDH-PQQ method?</p>
</li><li>ACCU-CHEK  by Roche
</li><li>FreeStyle by Abbott Diabetes Care
</ul><p>Q. Has FDA given a warning for the GDH-PQQ?</p>
</li><li>yes
</li><li>FDA has issued a warning for the same
</li><li>Ref: https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/707464

</ul><p>Q. Does the ACCU-CHECK available in India also have the GDH-PQQ method?</p>
</li><li>No. It uses the **Mut Q-GDH** method 
</li><li>Here is a list of various methods used by various glucometers worldwide:

<p>Q.  What is the impact of oxygen levels on  Glucometers ?</p>
</li><li>Glucometers that use  glucose oxidase  method are more likely to be impacted by oxygen levels
</li><li>Glucose dehydrogenase method glucometers are NOT impacted by oxygen levels
</li><li>Higher oxygen tensions- arterial blood or oxygen therapy may result in false low values
</li><li>Lower oxygen tensions - can cause false high readings
    </li><li>High altitude
    </li><li>Hypoxia
    </li><li>Venous blood readings
