- **Important points**:
    - The diabetes in Cystic fibrosis is unique, having features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
    - However, patients with CF usually don't develop complete insulinopenia, making ketosis rare.
    - Impaired glucose tolerance often develops first without accompanying fasting hyperglycemia. This progresses to impaired glucose tolerance with elevated fasting glucose levels, eventually leading to frank diabetes.
    - The preferred screening method for patients with CF is the 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.
    - **Hemoglobin A1c testing isn't sensitive and shouldn't be used for screening or diagnosing CFRD.** #ClinicalPearl
    - Consensus guidelines recommend screening for CFRD starting at age 10, though some CF centers begin screening at a younger age.
    
- **Q. What is the etiology of Cystic fibrosis?**
    - It results from a deficiency of the CFTR protein.
    - This causes defective chloride transport.
    - This defect makes secretions from various body organs thick and viscous.

- **Q. How is the diagnosis of Cystic fibrosis established?**

- **Q. List the systems involved in Cystic fibrosis.**
    - Pulmonary: bronchiectasis, sinusitis, recurrent pulmonary infections.
    - GIT: recurrent pancreatitis, malabsorption.
    - Endocrine: diabetes, osteoporosis.
    - Genitourinary: absent vas deferens, infertility in both males and females.
    
- **Q. What is the mode of inheritance?**
    - Autosomal recessive.
    - Multiple genes can lead to the clinical picture, resulting in variable clinical symptoms.
    
- **Q. Which is the primary investigation to diagnose cystic fibrosis?**
    - Elevated sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l confirms Cystic fibrosis.
    
- **Q. At what age does diabetes typically occur in cystic fibrosis?**
    - Middle school age and older.
    
- **Q. What is the etiology of diabetes in cystic fibrosis?**
    - Progressive destruction and fibrosis of the pancreas.
    
- **Q. Which clinical points are potentially related to Diabetes in cystic fibrosis?**
    - Presence of respiratory disease.
    - Presence of pancreatic insufficiency.
    
- **Q. What are the consequences of diabetes on other manifestations of cystic fibrosis?**
    - Increased pulmonary infections and insufficiency.
    - Increased mortality.
    - Worsened nutritional status.
    
- **Q. How is screening for diabetes in cystic fibrosis conducted?**
    1. Annually using OGTT starting at 10 years of age.
        - HbA1c isn't used due to its low sensitivity in cystic fibrosis.
    2. During pregnancy.
    3. During pulmonary exacerbations.
    
- **Q. What is the clinical definition of diabetes in cystic fibrosis?**
    - Fasting >125 mg/dl â€“ OGTT isn't needed.
    - 2hr PG2BS in OGTT >200 mg/dl â€“ confirms diabetes with or without fasting hyperglycemia.
    
- **Q. What is indeterminate hyperglycemia in cystic fibrosis?**
    - 1 hr OGTT >200.
    - 2 hr <140.
    
- **Q. What is the management of choice for patients with CFRD?**
    - Insulin is the preferred treatment.
    
- **Q. Should insulin be used in patients with indeterminate hyperglycemia or IGT?**
    - In selected cases, insulin is initiated.
    - Especially in those experiencing pulmonary exacerbations.
    - It enhances nutritional status.
    
- **Q. Why are CFRD patients at a higher risk of hypoglycemia?**
    - Poor nutritional intake and glycogen stores lead to fasting hypoglycemia.
    - Disordered insulin release results in reactive hypoglycemia post meals.
    - Reduced glucagon response (though catecholamine response remains normal).
    
- **Q. What is the primary goal of therapy in CFRD with insulin?**
    1. The main objective is to maintain nutritional status (avoiding excessive catabolism).
    2. To prevent pulmonary exacerbations.
    - This contrasts with type 1 diabetes, where the primary therapy goal is preventing microvascular complications.
    
- **Q. What is the therapy goal?**
    - Keep HBA1c as low as possible (it's not used for diagnosis but for monitoring) â€“ ideally below 5.5% if achievable without hypoglycemia.
    - Reduce postprandial BG â€“ ideally measured 1 hr post meal, aiming for <140 mg/dl.
    - Maintain fasting levels between 70-90 mg/dl.
    
- **Q. How and when is screening for microvascular disease conducted?**
    - 5 years after diagnosing CFRD.
    
- **Q. True or false, does insulin treatment in CFRD improve the overall outcome and lung functions?**
    - True.
