- Q. Give the diagnostic criteria for suspecting MODY.
    - Autosomal dominant transmission across three generations
    - Onset before age 25 in one of the affected members of the pedigree
    - Non-ketotic presentation
    - Non-obese body habitus.
- Q. How many forms of MODY exist as of today?
    - 11 forms of MODY exist
    - A recent review also included ABCC8 and KCNJ11 in the MODY list – hence 13 forms of MODY are now enlisted
- Q. How is insulin released in the body?
    - Basal insulin secretion
        - Transcription factors play a role in the release of basal insulin
            - HNF 4alpha
            - HNF1 alpha
            - IPF1
            - HNF 1 beta
            - NeuroD1
    - Nutrient-mediated insulin release
        - Glucose  (GLUT2) → pancreatic beta cell → (glucokinase) → Glucose 6 phosphatase → glucolysis → Mitochondria → ATP
        - ATP → closes ATP sensitive potassium channel → prevents Potassium to flux out → depolarize the cell → Open of calcium channel → influx of calcium → movement of insulin containing granules → release of insulin
    - Basal insulin release
- #Pearl
    - Closure/inhibition of K+ Channel releases insulin ….
    - If it remains open- neonatal diabetes
    - If it remains closed – hypoglycemia
- Q. What are the pools of insulin collection in the beta cells?
    - Two pools
    - One is close to the plasma membrane  release → 1st phase insulin secretion
    - 2nd is more interior → 2nd phase insulin secretion
- Q. What are the features of MODY?
- Autosomal dominant
    - Single gene defects
    - History in 2-3 generation
    - Onset before 25-35 years of age
    - Lean
    - Non-ketotic, non-insulin-dependent
    - Most present around puberty
- Q. Enlist the various MODY.

- Q. Which is the commonest MODY?
    - MODY 3- HNF 1 alpha
    - This is present in 58% of MODY cases
- Q. Which is more common in children and which is more common in adults?
    - Glucokinase – MODY- more common presentation in children
    - MODY3- more common presentation in adults
- #pearl
    - MODY2 – mild – no treatment required except in pregnancy
    - MODY1 and MODY3- can be treated with SU
- Q. Give a perspective of how common is MODY in children.
    - 15% of children presenting with diabetes are antibody negative
    - 15% of these will be MODY
    - So pretty rare
    - About 1.2% according to the SEARCH study
-  MODY 3 
- Q. Which cells express HNF 1alpha?
    - Liver and pancreas
- Q. What is the link between MODY 1 and MODY 3?
    - HNF 4 alpha regulates the action of HNF 1 alpha
    - Hence there is a link between MODY 1 and MODY 3
- Q. Does insulin levels decline in MODY3?
    - Yes
    - There is a progressive insulinopenia in MODY3 with age
-  MODY 2 
- Q. What is the main defect that occurs here?
    - There is reduced sensitivity to glucose by the beta cells
    - insulin is released at a higher level of glucose compared to normal
- Q. What happens if there is a homozygous mutation in GCK?
    - Then you develop neonatal diabetes
- #Pearl
- GCK
    - Homozygous mutation- Neonatal diabetes
    - Heterozygous mutation -  MODY2
- Q. How much glucose must be phosphorylated by glucokinase in normal conditions to release insulin?
    - At least 30% of the glucose must be phosphorylated to release insulin
    - This occurs at blood glucose of around 90 mg/dl
    - In MODY2 – there is reduced phosphorylation of glucose – hence glucose rises to more level before it is 30% phosphorylated
    - In NDM due to GCK- there is no phosphorylation of glucose and hence no release of insulin
- Q. How common is a microvascular complication in GCK?
    - They don’t develop microvascular complications
    - Risk of these complications is the same as the general population without diabetes
- Q. How common is GCK mutation in the general population?
    - 1 in 1000
- Q. When does the hyperglycemia start?
    - It starts in childhood itself
- Q. When are these patients recognized?
    - Often by routine screening especially during pregnancy
- Q. Is treatment recommended?
    - No except in pregnancy

    - Hypomagnesemia
    - Sensorineural deafness 
- Q. Do patients with  MODY 5  have a family history?
    - 30-40% of MODY5 mutations are spontaneous and hence family history may not be present! 
    - Even with the same mutation- there is a difference in phenotype observed even in the same family 
- Q. Do MODY5 have insulin resistance?
    - Compared to other MODY- MODY-5 tends to have more insulin resistance
- Q. What happens to the pancreas in this patient?
    - They have pancreatic atrophy - may also have exocrine dysfunction 
- #pearl- Renal dysfunction is more common in MODY-5 and hence may present to a nephrologist before they go to an endocrinologist 
- Q. How does MODY differ from type 1 diabetes?
    - Nonketotic
    - Antibodies negative
    - No relation with high-risk alleles – HLA
- Q. How does MODY differ from type 2?

    - Normal insulin sensitivity
- Q. Is it more common in Caucasians?
    - No
    - It is common in all races
- Q. How long do MODY patients maintain SU sensitivity?
    - Rule of thumb is 1/3rd or ½ lose their SU sensitivity over time
- Pearl
    - Transition of NDM patient from insulin to SU should be done only after hospitalization and not on an OPD basis
- Q. How do you treat MODY5?
    - Initially respond to SU
    - Eventually require insulin
- Q. Can insulin gene mutation also cause transient NDM?
    - Yes
    - However, most cases are permanent
    - It is an important cause of permanent neonatal diabetes
- Q. Which is the most common monogenic form of diabetes?
    - MODY
- Q. Which is the most common form of MODY?
    - HNF 1 alpha- MODY3 = 50%
    - GCK – MODY 2- 25%
    - HNF 4 alpha- MODY 1 = 10%
- Q. What are the defects in HNF 4 alpha?
    - It is an insulin secretory defect
- Q. Do patients with MODY 1 develop microvascular complications?
    - Yes
- Q. Does a patient with GCK defect (MODY 2 develop microvascular complications)?
    - No they don’t
- Q. How can MODY 3 (HNF 1 alpha) be detected early?
    - There is a reduction of renal threshold (mainly due to defect in SGLT)
    - Hence glycosuria may develop before hyperglycemia
    - Hence test for urine glucose 2 hours after glucose load can be used to detect an early defect in relatives of a patient with HNF 1 alpha
    - Similarly, 1,5 Anhydroglucitol can help diagnose MODY 3 early
- Q. Do they have an increased risk of CV mortality (MODY3)?
    - Yes

        - They have all other features except Diabetes insipidus
        - They tend to develop a gastrointestinal ulcer
- Q. What is the pathogenesis seen in this condition?
    - the children have a mutation in the WFS1 gene which encodes for a protein Wolfarmin
    - This is present in the Endoplasmic reticulum  and deficiency of this leads to increase  Endoplasmic reticulum stress  leading to early apoptosis of cells
- Q. What are the features of diabetes seen in this condition?
    - Diabetes seen here is associated with  Beta-cells  apoptosis
    - Hence presents like  Type 1 Diabetes  - may also have ketoacidosis
    - However, the long-term course is milder compared to type 1 and may also have fewer microvascular complications
    - This is generally the first manifestation

    - Retinal thinning 
- Q. When is deafness seen?
    - It occurs in 2nd decade of life 
- Q. Do these children have other urinary abnormalities other than just having  Diabetes insipidus?
    - Yes
    - A spectrum of urological abnormalities has been described in WS, such as a large atonic bladder, a low capacity, a high-pressure bladder with sphincter dyssynergia, and hydroureteronephrosis. 
    - Yearly assessment of renal function, measurement of postvoid residual urine volume by renal ultrasound, and urodynamic testing are recommended
