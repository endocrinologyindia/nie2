- Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for  Latent autoimmune diabetes of Adulthood (LADA) ?
    - Age > 30 year
    - At least 1 insulin cell autoantibodies positive
    - Period of 6 months on insulin independence


- Q. What are the expanded clinical criteria for  Latent autoimmune diabetes of Adulthood (LADA) ?
    - Age at onset > 30 years
    - A family or personal history of autoimmunity
    - A reduced frequency of metabolic syndrome compared with people with full-on type 2 diabetes: lower HOMA, lower body mass index, lower blood pressure, normal HDL compared with people with type 2 diabetes
    - No disease-specific difference in cardiovascular outcomes between these patients and those with type 2 diabetes
    - C-peptide levels fall more slowly than in traditional type 1 diabetes
    - Positivity for anti-GAD antibodies is the most sensitive marker, but other autoantibodies can be found as well, just less frequently
    - Non–insulin-requiring at the onset 


- Q. Which is the preferred marker to diagnose LADA?
    - Anti GAD65


- Q. What are the subtypes of LADA?
    - LADA1 – lesser C peptide, more ketosis-prone, higher GAD antibody
    - LADA2- greater C peptide, less ketosis-prone, lesser GAD antibody positivity


- Q. What is LADY?
    - Latent autoimmune diabetes in Young
    - Similar to LADA but age is <30 years 


- Q. What is the importance of a positive GAD antibody in any diabetic individual?
    - Positive GAD antibody in any diabetic predicts the requirement for early insulin requirement


- Q. Which is the latest antibody for  Type 1 Diabetes  or  Latent autoimmune diabetes of Adulthood (LADA) ?
    -  Tetraspanin 7 


- Q. Are there any benefits of early insulin initiation?
    - Yes
    - Early insulin initiation would help give rest to beta-cell and give overall good control


- Q. Which heat shock protein has been found to reduce beta-cell destruction?
    - Diapep 277- a heat shock protein 60 derivative has been found to reduce the incidence of beta-cell destruction in both type 1 diabetes and LADA


- Q. What vaccine has been found to retard  beta-cell damage?
    - Anti GAD65 vaccine – DIAMYD


- Q. How do these vaccines work?
    - They cause a shift from pro-inflammatory Th1 cells to anti-inflammatory Th2 cells
    - This shift suppresses the cytokine produced by Th1
    - This is a form of “acquired immune tolerance”


- Q. What is the core difference between adult type 1 diabetes and LADA?
    - The core difference is the speed of the beta-cell destruction leading to the dependency on insulin
    - Adult-onset  Type 1 Diabetes  have more rapid beta-cell destruction unlike LADA
    - This is differentiated by the criteria which say 6 or more months of insulin independence after onset which is required for LADA
        - If insulin requirement is before 6 months - it is adult type 1 
        - otherwise, it is LADA


- Q. Which OAD must be avoided for use in LADA?
    - Avoid sulphonylurea


- Q. Can other OAD be used in LADA?
    - Yes
    - There are small studies for benefit of all other OADs including  SGLT2i  in LADA patients 


- Q. Should all patients with  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus  be screened for LADA?
    - Yes
    - According to the recent guidelines on the topic 


- Q. Give the algorithm for diagnosis and management of  Latent autoimmune diabetes of Adulthood (LADA)

- Q. What is the C-peptide-based approach to the management of a patient with LADA?
    -  C-peptide 
        - <0.9 ng/ml (0.3 nmol/l) - Patient should be on basal bolus insulin
        - 0.9-2.1 ng/ml (0.3-0.7 nmol/l) - Patient should be on basal insulin plus OAD
        - More than 2.1 ng/ml (>0.7 nmol/l) - treat with OAD and/or as per the ADA guidelines for type 2 diabetes


- Q. What should be the glucose levels while performing the  C-peptide  assay?
    - 80-180 mg/dl


- Q. Apart from the insulin requirement and OAD, which other factors must be kept in mind when a patient has LADA instead of  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus ?
    - Increased risk of other autoimmune diseases - including hypothyroidism

- Q. What were the conclusion from the Botnia study group published in 2010 ?
    - The study was done to look at the impact of GAD antibody in the future risk of diabetes in non diabetic individuals
    - The study found the the following:
        - • GADA positivity is a strong predictor of diabetes, regardless of family history.
        - • People with high GADA concentrations are at an increased risk of developing diabetes.
        - • GADA positivity tends to occur in families with type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.
        - • Low or medium levels of GADA do not impact the incidence of diabetes in individuals without a family history of diabetes.
        - • Elevated GADA concentrations indicate an increased risk of diabetes in both relatives and control subjects.
        - • The risk of diabetes is influenced by age, sex, BMI, GADAs, and family history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
        - • GADA positivity significantly raises the risk of diabetes, in addition to traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes
        - This flow chart summarizes this well:

- Q. What level of [[GAD65 antibody\|GAD65 antibody]] was considered as positive in this study ?
    - Levels about 32 IU/l were considered positive
- Q. Should patients with LADA be given SU ? Does it impact long term beta-cell reserve ?
    - A study published in JCEM concluded that it is better to give insulin early and not [[Sulphonylurea\|Sulphonylurea]] in patients with LADA
    - Study conducted by Taro Maruyama et al. that focused on comparing the effectiveness of insulin therapy versus sulfonylurea (SU) treatment in preserving or reversing beta-cell function in patients with slowly progressive insulin-dependent diabetes or LADA.
    - The study was a randomized clinical trial that included 60 patients with a 5-year duration or shorter of diabetes.
    - The primary endpoint of the study was an insulin-dependent state defined by low levels of serum C-peptide values.
    - The results showed that the progression rate to an insulin-dependent state was lower in the insulin group compared to the SU group, indicating that insulin therapy may be more effective in preserving beta-cell function in LADA patients.
