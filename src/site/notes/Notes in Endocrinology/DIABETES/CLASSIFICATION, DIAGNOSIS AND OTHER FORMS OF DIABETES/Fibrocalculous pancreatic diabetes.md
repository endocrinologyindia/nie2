    - Abdominal pain- the first symptom- in childhood
    - Pancreatic calculi- In adolescent
    - Diabetes – in adulthood 


- Q. Where is the calcification seen in Plain Xray in FCPD? 
    - Close to L1/L2 vertebra 


- Q. Ketosis is present in FCPD. True or false? 
    - False 
    - Patients with FCPD do not develop ketosis


- Q. Intake of which food substance is implicated in causing FCPD? 
    - Cassava


- Q. Which cancer risk is increased in FCPD ? 
    - Pancreatic cancer


- Q. There are no microvascular complications in FCPD, True or false? 
    - False
    - It was believed earlier but no so anymore
    - Microvascular complications are very much present in patients with FCPD


- Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for FCPD? 
    - As given by Mohan et al
        - Essential criteria
            - Diabetes present
            - Patient from a tropical country
            - Absence of any other cause of pancreatitis 
    - Any 3 of the following
        - Abnormal morphology of pancreas on imaging
        - Abnormal pancreatic function test
        - Abdominal pain –recurrent since childhood
        - Steatorrhea 


- Q. Which is the tumor marker for pancreatic cancer? 
    - CA 19-9


- Q. What is the classical clinical description of a patient with FCPD? 
    - Cyanotic hue
    - emaciated
    - Parotidomegaly
    - Abdominal distention 


- Q. Why is there no ketosis in FCPD? 
    - Some of the theories for absence of ketosis in FCPD are as follows
        - No non-esterified fatty acid hence less substrate for ketosis
        - Also there is reduced glucagon along with insulin
            - High glucagon and reduced insulin is required for ketosis to develop 
        - The fat present is resistant to lipolysis
        - There is some eesidual beta-cell function
        - Carnitine deficiency – prevents Fatty acid entering the mitochondria for beta-oxidation 


- Q. Is the calcification present in the parenchyma or in the duct ? 
    - FCPD- in the duct
    - Alcoholic pancreatitis – in the parenchyma 


- Q. What is the composition of the calculi ? 
    - It is composed of calcium carbonate 


- Q. Can ERCP and EUS be used to define pancreatic morphology in FCPD ? 
    - Yes 


- Q. Which is the invasive test for detecting pancreatic function ? 
    - Injection of secretin and Pancreozymin
    - Collection of pancreatic juice
    - Juice contains less of lipase, bicarbonate and trypsin compared to normal


- Q. Which are non-invasive (tubeless tests for pancreatic function) ?
    - BT-PABA (Bentriomide para aminobenzyoic acid)  - Urine / plasma 
    - Fecal elastase
    - Fecal chymotrypsin 


- Q. Which is the gold standard Tubeless test ? 
    - Fecal elastase 


- Q. How Is endocrine pancreatic function tested for in FCPD ? 
    - Using C-peptide
    - The value is intermediate between type 1 and type 2 – suggestive of residual pancreatic function 


- Q. What is done for abdominal pain in FCPD ? 
    - It occurs earlier 
    - Non-opiod / opiod analgesisc are used
    - It resolves once the endocrine dysfunction occurs
    - Pancreatic enzyme supplementation does not reduce the pain 


- Q. What is done for non resolving pain ? 
    - ESWL + ERCP
    - Celiac plexus block
    - Surgery drainage procedures – ductal decompression or pancreaticojejunostomy 
    - Surgery ablative procedures – partial or subtotal pancreatectomy 


- Q. What is done for the management of steatorrhea? 
    - Pancreatic enzyme supplementation
    - Reduce diet fat
    - Give vitamins 


- Q. What is the dose of pancreatic enzyme supplementation in these patients?  
    - Typical brand name is "Creon" 10,000 units before each meal

#Clinicalpearl 
- In clinical practice is is observed that giving pancreatic enzyme supplement also has some beneficial effect on glycemic control. Some experts have suggested a link between the exocrine and endocrine dysfunctions. 

- Q. What is the best treatment of diabetes in these patients?  
    - 85% require insulin
    - Some may do well with OAD because of residual pancreatic function
    - However, incretin-based therapies are best avoided 
    - They often have brittle diabetes and prone to hypoglycemia


- Q. What is done for nutrition ?  
    - Diet rich in proteins and carbs are given to combat  the malnutrition
    - Fat-soluble vitamins
    - Avoid fat – to reduce steatorrhea

- Q. Is malnutrition a cause or effect of FCPD?  
    - Recent studies suggest malnutrition is an effect rather than the cause of FCPD 


- Q. Enlist the various theories for FCPD over time? 
    - Cassava theory – Geerverghese and McMillin
    - Increase oxidative stress theory
    - Genetic theory – recent theory 


- Q. Which genetic mutation has been associated with FCPD ? 
    - SPINK1
    - PRSS1 and PRSS2
    - Chymotrypsinogen C 


- Q. Diabetes onset is at what age ? 
    - Generally age 20-30 years 
    - About 1-2 decade after first episode of abdominal pain 


- Q. Is insulin secretory defect established in FCPD? 
    - Yes 


- Q. Is the exocrine and endocrine deficiency linked? 
    - It seems from some of the studies done by Yajnik et al 


- Q. What is the newer paradigm in the etiology of diabetes in FCPD? 
    - New interest in FCPD is directed to insulin resistance as a cause of diabetes in FCPD 


- Q. What is the link between insulin resistance and chronic pancreatitis? 
    - Some studies have shown that patient with pancreatic diabetes have hepatic insulin resistance due to internalization of hepatic insulin receptors and GLUT2
    - The role of the pancreatic polypeptide has also been proposed 


- Q. What is the role of a pancreatic polypeptide? 
    - Studies have shown that pancreatic polypeptide regulates the expression of the IR gene in the liver
    - Thus impairment of PP will impair glucose homeostasis via IR gene expression in liver 


- Q. Do patients with FCPD have insulin resistance similar to Type 2 diabetes patients? 
    - Yes
    - This is according to a study by Mohan et al 
    - So FCPD patients have insulin resistance similar to type 2 diabetics! 


- Q. Is the BMI in these patients showing something else? 
    - Singla et al. showed that these patients have higher body fat percentage despite low BMI
    - This could contribute to the insulin resistance 


- Q. What is the vicious cycle of glucagon and insulin? 
    - As far as 35 years ago, it was proposed that diabetes is not just an insulin problem but also a problem with glucagon
    - Insulin resistance increases insulin production and secretion → higher intra-islet insulin concentration → increase glucagon production → further increase insulin secretion → vicious circle 


- Q. Is glucagon indeed depleted in patients with FCPD? 
    - This theory is questioned now
    - Some studies by Mohan and Yajnik have shown that FCPD may have preserved glucagon response and selective damage to beta cells 


- Q. What is the role of incretin hormones in the pathogenesis of diabetes in chronic pancreatitis 
    - Knop et al. suggested that CP without diabetes had an intact incretin response compared to CP with diabetes
    - This may be the missing link in FCPD
    - Also, he showed that pancreatic enzyme replacement might augment incretin response- a theory that could have an impact on the management of FCPD 


- Q. What is the role of body composition causing diabetes in FCPD? 
    - There is a theory that the lack of fat tissue may be to lipodystrophy like effect, which can lead to insulin resistance in FCPD patients
    - Deficiency fat stores  increase hepatic triglyceride stores → increase circulating fatty acids → improve insulin resistance 



#Real-life-cases

Date - Monday, 19 April 2021

- A 30 year old male presented with history of unintentional weight loss
- His weight reduced from 100 kg to 70 kg over a period of 3 months
- During this process the patient was found to have hyperglycemia
- The patient was started on insulin, some weight was regained but over a few weeks he started developing hypoglycemia
- Insulin was stopped and the patient was started on Oral antidiabetics by his physician 
- At age of 25, he had recurrent episodes of abdominal pain which were never investigated
- When he came to us he had an HbA1c of 10% 
- Looking at the unusual history, we decided to perform a CT scan of the abdomen
- True to what we suspected, we found the pancreas studded with calcification
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FEmBie-88SA.png?alt=media&token=47c5fdc6-064e-4ef4-945f-90fa4c84ecaf)
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FnSdcah-0M0.png?alt=media&token=5981201c-9113-438f-9a81-bacd0f673a24)
- There was no evidence of malignancy - however the risk and screening for the same has been explained to the patient 
- The patient was restarted on insulin and pancreatic enzyme supplementation along with nutritional replenishment 
- Currently he has regained some weight and maintain good glycemic control 



Things to learn from the case:

- Sometimes a diagnosis of FCPD can be made retrospectively !
- In patients with acute symptomatic hyperglycemia- if the [[Notes in Endocrinology/DIABETES/PATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES/Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)\|Glucose Toxicity (Glucotoxicity)]] breaks- the patient can start developing hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is higher in patients with FCPD
- Abdominal pain can disappear over a period of time. At later age the patient may present with just exocrine and endocrine insufficiency
- This patient is from Rajasthan. FCPD is not restricted to some regions of the country and can be considered a pan-Indian issue 


#Updates ; Date: Friday, 9 July 2021

-   Q. Can you give a map of regions in the world in which [[Notes in Endocrinology/DIABETES/CLASSIFICATION, DIAGNOSIS AND OTHER FORMS OF DIABETES/Fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes\|Fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes]] is seen ?
