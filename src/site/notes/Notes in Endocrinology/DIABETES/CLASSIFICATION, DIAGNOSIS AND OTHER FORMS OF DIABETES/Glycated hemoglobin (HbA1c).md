- Q. Who was the first to describe  HbA1c?
    - Rhabar et al 
- Q. What is the most appropriate Term for HbA1c?
    - It is glycated hemoglobin and not glycosylated hemoglobin
    - Glycosylated suggests it is an enzymatic process whereas, in reality, it is a non-enzymatic reaction
- Q. What does 1c stand for in HbA1c ?
    - 1c stands for the order of hemoglobin molecules on electrophoresis
- Q. On what chain of the hemoglobin is the glucose added?
    - It is added to the beta-chain of the hemoglobin 
- Describe the steps to HBA1c formation?
    - Glucose binds to the N terminal of valine residue on the Beta chain of HbA
    - Formation of Schiff’s bases (Aldimine) non-enzymatically →
    - Converts to Amadori product (Irreversible ketamine) →
    - Intermediate glycosylation production → 
    - Cross-links- Advanced glycosylation end products
- Q. What part of the above reaction are we measuring when we measure HbA1c?
    - We are measuring the irreversible ketoamine and not the Schiff’s base aldimine
    - The Aldimine is transient and reflects acute glucose fluctuation
    - While the Ketoamine is irreversible and represents chronic hyperglycemia
- Q. HbA1c reflects what period of glycemic control?
    - It reflects truly the glycemic control of only the last 8 weeks
    - Even though the idea is that it lasts the entire period of RBC which is 120 days in reality it only lasts for 8 weeks
    - 50% of the HbA1c is formed in the last 1 month and that of last 3-4 months only contribute 10%
- Q. What are more glycated – The older RBCs or reticulocytes?
    - The older RBCs are more glycated than reticulocytes
- **Hba1c assays and methods**

- Q. Which assay was used in the DCCT trial?
    - It used D10 cation exchange HPLC
    - To be specific- BIORAD DIAMAT using Bio-Rex 70 resin was used in DCCT and also UKPDS
- Q. What is ADAG?
    - It is the study that came up with the estimated average glucose (eAG) formula for HbA1c
    - Study was called "A1c Derived glucose"
- Q. What is the ADAG formula?
    - eAG = 28.7 x HbA1c – 46.7
- **Standardization **
- Q. What is the difference between standardization and harmonization?
    - Harmonization- calibrating the assay using an arbitrarily chosen standard
    - Standardization- calibrating the assay using a standard that is of high order
- Q. What is the current standardization process for HbA1c?
    - Old standardization was done by NGSP (National glycohemoglobin standardization program) which standardized using an assay that was used in DCCT
    - This assay was an HPLC ion exchange electrophoresis
    - It reported as % of total hemoglobin
    - It was harmonization and not standardization
    - The newer standardization is given by IFCC (international federation for clinical chemists)
    - It is a different assay
    - It reports the value as mmol/mol
- Q. How is the IFCC reference derived?
    - 3 steps
	    - Step 1
		    - Hb separated from lysed RBC is cleaved using endoproteinase
	    - Step 2
		    - The glycated and non-glycated particles are separated using HPLC
	    - Step 3
	    - The glycated particles which are separated are measured using capillary electrophoresis
- Q. How is the current reporting done?
    - According to the current consensus the reporting is to be done in three formats
    - IFCC – using mmol/mol value
    - NGSP - % value
    - eAG from ADAG formula
- Q. What is the relation between the new assay of IFCC and DCCT assay?
    - The new assay gives a value that is 1.5% lower than the older assay
- Q. How is the NGSP value of % divided by the IFCC value?
    - Using the formula  0.0914 * IFCC + 2.152
- Q. Using the formula what is HbA1c <7 % in IFCC terms?
    - It is around 53 mmol/mol
- Q. Which anticoagulant is used while taking an HbA1c blood sample?
    - EDTA
- Q. What should the CV be for HbA1c?
    - Interlaboratory  -  CV <3%
    - Intralaboratory  -CV  <5%
- **FALSE VALUES**
- Q. What are the common causes of false high and false low values of HbA1c?
    - False High
        - Iron deficiency anemia
        - B12 and folic acid deficiency
        - CKD (uremia)- carbamylated hemoglobin
        - Asprin
        - HbF and HbG
    - False low
        - HbS and HbC
        - Hemolytic anemia
        - Pregnancy
- Q. Do the Hemoglobin variants always create a problem?
    - No
    - The newer HPLC and Capillary electrophoresis methods tend to separate the Hb variants and hence do not interfere with the test results
    - The chemical methods do not normally separate the Hb variants
- Q. What happens in CKD?
    - Carbamylated Hb- false high
    - Increase hemolysis and use of EPO  - false low
- Q. What are the racial differences in HbA1c?
    - They are uncertain
    - But Africans and Hispanics- Higher HbA1c
    - Asian and Caucasians- lower HbA1c
- Q. What is the relation between HBA1c and age?
    - With every decade of life HBA1c increase by 0.1% or 1 mmol/mol
- Q. Why does HbA1c correlate so well with  Diabetic microvascular complications 
    - Glucose enters the RBC via the GLUT1  channel
    - here is bonds to the N-terminus of the Hemoglobin beta-chain to produce an HbA1c
    - Glucose also enters the tissue in which microvascular complications are seen via  GLUT1 
    - hence the glucose levels intracellular in these organs (kidney, retina, neurons) are similar to that in RBC
    - hence HbA1c correlates well with microvascular complications
- Q. What is the Glycation gap?
    - glycation gap is the difference between the measured HbA1c and the predicted HbA1c 
    - this article writes that in almost 30% of patients with  Type 1 Diabetes - the HbA1c values do not correlate with the measured  SMBG  values! 
- Q. Does the type of sample- arterial, venous, or capillary affect the results?
    - No data regarding arterial, but generally capillary testing is similar to venous
    - the difference is NOT significant 
- Q. Does Point of care testing for HBA1c give inferior results?
    - Not necessarily 
- Q. Does HbA1c show diurnal variation ?
    - No
- Q. What about seasonal variation?
    - Yes
    - Levels may be elevated in Winter #ClinicalPearl
- Q. How long can it be stored?
    - In normal conditions, it can be stored easily
    - Storage at 4 degrees is preferred for ion-exchange methods
    - Long-term storage upto 10 years at -70 degrees is possible
- Q. Does drug intake interfere with the value?
    -  Vitamin C  and  Aspirin  in very high doses may have an impact
    - but are megadoses and not clinically relevant 
- ^^#ClinicalPearl- 50% of the value of HbA1c is impacted by the glucose value in the recent months time^^ - so it is skewed mean and not exact mean of 3 months 
- Q. Does  Iron deficiency anemia impact the HbA1c? #ClinicalPearl
    - Yes 
    - it increases the HbA1c because of increased RBC lifespan 
    - giving iron to these patients lowers the HbA1c 
- Q. What happens to HbA1c in  Sickle cell anemia?
    - HbA1c would not be accurate in Sickle-cell anemia
    - since SCA is associated with a defect in Beta-chain and HbA1c has to do with the beta-chain
    - Any form of Hemoglobinopathy that leads to lower or abnormal beta-chain leads to abnormality in HbA1c values 
- Q. What HbA1c value can be useful for the diagnosis of  Gestational Diabetes mellitus (GDM)? #ClinicalPearl #Googlekeep
    - Ball-park figure- HBA1c of >5.9% strongly correlates with GDM 
- Q. Does hypothyroidism have any relation with HbA1c? #ClinicalPearl
    - Some studies have shown that  Subclinical hypothyroidism  and  Overt hypothyroidism  are associated with a mild increase of HbA1c which corrects on  Levothyroxine  supplementation 
- Q. Is HbA1c reliable in a patient with cirrhosis? #ClinicalPearl
    - No
    - because of several factors HbA1c is not very reliable in patients with  CLD 
- Q. What about  CKD? #ClinicalPearl
    - Some experts say
        - Don't use HBA1c for diagnosis of diabetes in CKD 1-3 - can use for monitoring therapy
        - Don't use HBA1c for diagnosis or treatment in patients with CKD  4/5 or   ESRD 
- Q. Which other drugs or factors can impact HbA1c?
    -  Dapsone  significantly reduced HbA1c and hence HbA1c should not be used in patients receiving Dapsone
    -  Vitamin E  may also reduce HBA1c levels 
    -  Hydroxyurea  may cause aberrant HbA1c levels 
- Q. Why does Dapsone reduce the HbA1c?
    - By causing hemolysis
    - several antiretroviral drugs like Ribavarin also impact HbA1c in a similar way 
- Q. Summarize the conditions producing false high and false low HBA1c.
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F29zv8rypV_.png?alt=media&token=907500e4-30ad-455e-9a9b-fc532a8dae2e)
- Q. In which condition should you consider hemoglobinopathy and the aberrant result of HbA1c?
    - 1. HBA1c >15%
    - 2. HBA1c and SMBG do not correlate
    - 3. A dramatic difference in HBA1c based on change of lab or methodology 
- Q. What is the impact of  Hypertriglyceridemia on HbA1c?
    - it produces false elevation of  HbA1c 
    - Similar thing is seen with  glucocorticoids  use
