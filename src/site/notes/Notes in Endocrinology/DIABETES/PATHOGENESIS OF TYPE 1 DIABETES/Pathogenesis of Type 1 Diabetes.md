- Q. Summarize the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in 1 sentence?
    - Immune-mediated destruction of beta-cell
    - Triggered by an environmental factor
    - In genetically susceptible individuals


- Q. What are the three main things in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis?
    - Genetic susceptibility
    - Immune effect
    - Environmental factors


- Q. What are type 1A and type 1B?
    - Type 1A- antibodies positive –immune-mediated beta-cell destruction
    - Type 1B – antibodies negative – non-immune-mediated beta-cell damage


- Q. Polymorphism of which gene causes type 1 diabetes?
    - HLA Dqbeta
    - HLA Dqalpha
    - HLA  DR
    - PTPN22
    - Preproinsulin
    - IL2 Receptor gene
    - CTLA-4
    - Intereron induced helicase
    - Lectin like gene
    - CCR5- emerging player


- Q. Of these genes which are involved, which are most important?
    - HLA- highest effect
    - Preproinsulin and insulin gene- 2nd
    - PTPN22- 3rd
    - CCR5- emerging star


- Q. What is the risk of type 1 diabetes in other family members if one person has it?
    - Offspring  - 6%
    - Sibling – 5%
    - Identical twin – 50%
    - All this is no family history – risk is only 0.4%


- **HLA (MHC GENES) **


- Q. HLA region of which chromosome is the culprit?
    - Chromosome 6q


- Q. What is the role of MHC?
    - MHC carry the antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and activate the  T cells


- Q. Which two haplotypes of HLA  confer the highest risk of type 1 diabetes?
    - HLA DR3, DQB1*0201 – Also called HLA DR3- DQ2
    - HLA DR4, DQB1*0302 – also called HLA DR4-DQ8
    - 90% of type 1 have either of these two haplotypes
    - 30% have both!
    - The risk of type 1 diabetes if you carry either of these two haplotypes is 5% compared to 0.4 % in controls


- Q. Which HLA DR4 haplotypes protect from type 1?
    - HLADRB1*0403
    - HLADPB1*0402
    - Additionally, HLA DQB1*0602 – also protective


- **NON-MHC GENES **


- **Pearl **


    - PTPN22 is the culprit in multiple autoimmune disorders


- Q. Which cytokine is a primary culprit in causing type 1?
    - INTERFERON-GAMMA
    - Th1 cells produce interferon-gamma
    - IL12 and Interferon-gamma releasing factors increase interferon-gamma


- Q. Are Th2 cells protective?
    - Initially, it was thought that
    - Th1- is causative
    - Th2 – protective
    - But new evidence is that Th2 is not very protective and may also be a culprit


- Q. What is the role of mutation in FoxP3 and diabetes?
    - FoxP3 mutation is seen in IPEX syndrome remember
    - Autoimmune disease like diabetes is an imbalance between Pathogenic T cells and regulatory T  cells
    - CD4 and CD25 are a significant subset of regulatory T cells and require IL-7 for activation
    - They lack an IL-7 receptor, and FoxP3 induces this receptor
    - Lack of FoxP3- there is no activation of regulatory cells  diabetes


- **Immunology of Type 1 Diabetes**


- Q. What components of the immune system are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes?
    - Four things characterize the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of type 1
    - Presence of islet autoantibodies
    - Presence of T cells that proliferate in the presence of these islet proteins (antigens)
    - Cytokines produced by T cells that cause pancreatic damage
    - Presence of activated lymphocytes in the pancreas (Insulinitis)


- **Autoantibodies **


- #Clinicalpearl: Antibodies in type 1 diabetes are not responsible for damage to beta-cell – they are mere markers of type 1 diabetes
- The actual damage is done by T cells and not these antibodies


- Q. Enlist the antibodies associated with type 1 diabetes?
    - GAD 65
    - Insulinoma associated antibody – IAD-2 (also called ICA512)
    - Insulin autoantibody – IAA
    - Zinc transporter eight antibody- Znt8


- Q. Antibodies are formed against which part of GAD65?
    - Carboxy terminal of GAD65 antibody


- Q. What is the other name of Insulinoma-associated antibody 2?
    - ICA512


- Q. Tell me something about the GAD65 antibody?
    - Present in 70% of type 1 diabetics
    - Does not reduce with age- most common antibody t checked in adults
    - Slowly developing diabetes
    - HLA-DR3 associated


- Q. Enlist the differences between GAD65 and IA-2 antibodies?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FtsAnhTdEVb.png?alt=media&token=a63f2b72-3c61-4541-91f3-f449e040cf7e)


- Q. Which is the main target in type 1 diabetes?
    - The main target seems to be the Beta chain of Insulin


- Q. Which is the first antibody to appear in type 1 diabetes?
    - IAA- insulin autoantibody is the first to appear


- Q.  If IAA is the first to appear, why does it not have more importance compared to GAD65, etc.?
    - Any person given insulin can develop IAA antibody
    - Hence measurement of antibody anytime after two weeks after insulin injection will give a positive result


- Q. Which is often the last antibody to appear?
    - Znt8
    - It also disappears first
    - IAA first,  then GAD → , then IA2 → Last ZnT8


- Q. Summarize the prevalence of various antibodies in type 1 diabetes?
    - IAA – almost 100% - but not a reliable marker
    - GAD65- 70%
    - IA-2 – 68%
    - Znt8 – 60-80%


- Q. Apart from the fantastic four, which other antibodies are proposed?
    - Antibodies against
    - IGRP
    - ICA69
    - Chromogranin A


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Antibodies of type 1 diabetes also affect the nervous system!



- Q. What do Indian studies say about Antibodies in type 1?
    - South Indian study – GAD65 was present in 70% - just like the west
    - Cuttack Study- ICA512 was more common – in 43%
    - GAD65 only in 7%


- **Role of cell-mediated immunity **

- Q. Which is the most commonly used animal model for type 1 diabetes?
    - NOD mice


- Q. Which cells are responsible for type 1  -  T cell or B cell?
    - T cell


- Q. Which causes diabetes- Th1 or Th2?
    - Th1- causative
    - Th2 – protective (however, the role of Th2 as protective has been questioned)


- Q. What is the relation between Th2 and gut?
    - Gut immunity develops via Th2
    - Th2 we know is protective
    - Hence oral insulin/antigens may have a role in causing tolerance to type 1 diabetes


- Q. Which cytokines produced by Beta-cell cells are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes?
    - Interferon-gamma – most important
    - TNF alpha
    - IL-1


- Q.. Is there molecular mimicry involved?
    - It is possible because antigens of Coxsackievirus is similar to GAD65


- Q. Are alpha cells, PP cells, Delta cells also damaged by autoimmunity in the pancreas?
    - No
    - They are spared


- Q. Do some detectable changes occur in the body in type 1 susceptible individuals even before autoimmune markers appear?
    - Yes
    - Some Metabolic changes that prepare the body for a proinflammatory response develop even before immune markers appear
    - These include:
		- Reduced serum succinate
		- Phospholipids
		- Ketoleucine
		- elevated glutamic acid


- Q. Summarize the steps in Immune events in type 1?


    - Step 0
        - Environmental triggers and genetic suspeblity set up the stage for the development of type 1 diabetes
    - Step 1a- The periphery
        - In the periphery, the environmental trigger produces a change in the system and changes the body to a proinflammatory system
        - In this proinflammatory environment,  there is an imbalance between  Pathogenic T cells and regulatory T cells – the pathogenic T cells dominate
        - Hence there is a generation of autoreactive T cells
    - Step 1b- the pancreas
        - Environmental triggers set up the immune destruction in beta cells
        - Beta cells of the pancreas, as a result, upregulate MHC class I and IFN- gamma
        - This sets them from attack by autoreactive CD8, which have specificity for islet antigens
    - Step 2
        - The destruction of beta cells produce more antigen, which is picked up by the APC present in the pancreas and taken to the lymphatic system
    - Step 3
        - These beta-cell antigens taken by the APC are transported to the periphery, where they activate CD4 T cells
        - CD 4 cells activate more autoreactive T cells and also activate B cells to produce autoantibodies
    - Step 4
        - Now, these antibodies and further T cells which are produced go to the pancreas and produce a second wave of attack
        - IFN gamma, TNF alpha, and IL-1 produced by T cell have the damage
        - This now stops the beta cell from producing insulin
        - This is called ‘Pseudoatrophy’ of beta cells
    - Step 5
        - The second wave of the attack  cycle repeats of producing more beta cell antigens and more Autoreactive T cell and autoantibodies
        - The regulatory T cells may put a brake on the process; hence there are fluctuating stages of destruction and repair
        - However, eventually, the autoreactive T cells win and lead to beta-cell destruction
    - Step 6
        - When only 10% of beta cells remain  full-blown, diabetes occurs
