- Q. How prevalent is diabetes in ages > 65 years?
    - 26%


- Q. What is the link between diabetes and dementia?
    - Diabetics are at increase risk of
        - Alzheimers
        - Vascular dementia
        - All-cause dementia


- Q. Which agents have shown potential benefit in the improvement of mild cognitive decline in diabetics?
    - Intranasal insulin
    - Metformin


- Q. Which factors are associated with cognitive decline in diabetes?
    - Duration of diabetes
    - Uncontrolled diabetes


- Q. Is hypoglycemia also linked with dementia?
    - Yes


- Q. Why do the elderly have more risk of hypoglycemia?
    - Cognitive decline- do not remember medications, insulin dosing, SMBG, etc
    - Renal insufficiency
    - Progressive decline in counterregulatory hormone
    - Hypoglycemic unawareness


- **Treatment goals in elderly **


- Q. What should be the goals in otherwise healthy elderly diabetic free from comorbidities having long life expectancy?
    - HbA1 < 7.5%
    - Fasting 90-130 mg/dl
    - Bedtime 90-150 mg/dl
    - BP <140/90
    - Statins- given unless contraindicated


- Q. What should the treatment goals in complex elderly with multiple comorbidities, mild to moderate cognitive decline, and intermediate life expectancy?
    - HbA1 < 8%
    - Fasting 90-150 mg/dl
    - Bedtime 100-180 mg/dl
    - BP <140/90
    - Statins- give unless contraindicated


- Q. What is done for very complex elderly with poor life expectancy and moderate to severe cognitive decline with end-stage chronic diseases?
    - HbA1 < 8.5%
    - Fasting 100-180 mg/dl
    - Bedtime 110-200 mg/dl
    - BP <150/90
    - Statins- only if benefit exceeds risk


- **Pharmacological therapy **


- Q. How is creatinine assessed in the elderly?
    - The elderly may have less muscle mass hence creatinine may be lower than younger adults
    - Hence creatinine may be falsely low
    - The timed urinary collection is more useful


- Q. Why are Thiazolidinones (TZD) not a preferred choice of Oral antidiabetics (OAD) in the elderly ? 
    - Thiazolidinone are linked with fracture hence use with caution in elderly


- Q. Which Sulphonylurea (SU) is relatively contraindicated in the elderly?
    - According to the American Academy of geriatrics it is best to avoid Glyburide (glibenclamide)


- Q. Which SU is safe in diabetics?
    - Short-acting SU like glipizide
    - Gliclazide- because it has low risk of hypoglycemia 


- Q. What is the difference in response to hypoglycemia in the elderly?
    - They have less adrenergic symptoms and directly and more frequently develop neuroglycopenia symptoms


- Q. What are additional problems with hypoglycemia in the elderly?
    - Cardiac autonomic dysfunction
    - CV risk and risk of SCD
    - Dementia
    - Falls → Fracture


- Q. Can DPPIV be used as first-line therapy in the elderly?
    - Yes
    - However, they may not  be very effective as monotherapy


- Q. Summaries the use of OAD in diabetics?
    - Glibenclamide, TZD- avoid
    - Other drugs – can be used


- **COMMON GERIATRIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES **


- Q. Is depression more common in elderly diabetics?
    - Yes


- Q. Does good glycemic control in the elderly increased the risk of falls or reduce the risk?
    - A study showed that intensive vs less intensive glycemic control in elderly- fall dependent upon the insulin use
    - Insulin – increases the risk of fall
    - Oral drugs- do not increase risk of fall


- Q. Enlist the other problems with old age and diabetes?
    - Urinary incontinence
    - Increase risk of falls
    - Polypharmacy
    - Dementia
    - Depression
