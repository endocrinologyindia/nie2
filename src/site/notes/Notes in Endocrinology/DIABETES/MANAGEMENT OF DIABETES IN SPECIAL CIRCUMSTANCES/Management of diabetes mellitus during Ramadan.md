- Q. How long during the day the fast lasts?
    - Since Ramadan is based on the Lunar calendar, it starts 10-11 day earlier each time
    - Hence the fasting may last longer in Summer times


- Q. What is the landmark epidemiological study for Diabetes and Ramadan?
    - EPIDIAR study


- Q. Are patients with Diabetes exempt from fast?
    - Yes
    - Yet they fast for 15 days at least


- Q. What is Shawwal ?
    - 1 month following Eid


- **Physiology of the Ramadan fast **


- Q. What asspects of physiology are affected during the Ramadan  ?
    - Meal times change 
    - Fluid homeostasis changes
    - Sleep and circadian rhythm changes
    - Changes in physical activity


- Q. What are the typical meal times in Ramadan?
    - 6:00 pm and 3:00 am


- Q. What is Suhoor?
    - Muslims wake up before dawn to eat before the fast begins
    - This is called Suhoor

- Q. What is  Iftar?
    - Evening meal after sunset
    - The largest calorie intake is during Iftar


- Q. What is the impact of sleep on Diabetes in Ramadan?
    - Sleep disturbance is well known to increase insulin resistance
    - There is noticed sleep disturbance in Ramadan
    - Its effect on Insulin resistance is not known, but it is likely it increases Insulin resistance


- Q. What happens he Cortisol in Ramadan ?
    - The cortisol circadian rhythm is changed
    - It is lower during the morning and higher in the evening
    - Hence they feel lethargy during daytime


- Q. What happens to hunger?
    - During the initial days, the hunger is increased, while during the later days of fast, there is adaptation- particularly in females


- Q. What happens to the bodyweight during Ramadan?
    - There are conflicting reports
    - Current evidence suggests that body weight reduces or remains the same during Ramadan
    - Males typically lose weight, while women maintain weight


- Q. How long do liver glycogen stores last during fasting?
    - 12-13 hours


- Q. Is liver glycogen depleted in Ramadan?
    - Yes
    - This is because Fast may last for >12 hours
    - Hence they are prone to ketosis after glycogen depletion


- Q. When does ketosis typically occur?
    - If they have their first meal before dawn- it typically occurs in the afternoon
    - While if they skip that meal – then it occurs in the morning time


- Q. Does this lead to changes in Fasting plasma glucose in people with Diabetes?
    - Interestingly No !
    - There is little change in Glucose levels observed in CGMS in diabetics
    - There is a mild increase after Iftar noted


- Q. What happens to lipid profile during Ramadan?
    - During Ramadan, there is an observed reduction in LDL
    - There is a favorable lipid profile during Ramadan months


- Q. What happens to leptin levels during Ramadan?
