Q. What is  Finerenone  ?

- Finerenone, sold under the brand name Kerendia, is a medication used to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attacks, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes. Finerenone is a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist(MRA)

Q. How does  Finerenone  compare to other steroidal  mineralocorticoid receptor  antagonists  MRA ?
    - It is a non-steroidal  MRA 
    - It has high potency and selective to  mineralocorticoid receptor 
    - It has a short half life of 2-3 hours
    - Little effect on BP
    - Less hyperkalemia
    - No sexual side effects
    - No CNS penetration

- Q. What is the dose of  Finerenone ?
    - 10 - 20 mg OD

- Q. What is difference between  FIDELIO-DKD  and  FIGARO-DKD  ?
    -  FIDELIO-DKD  looked at renal outcomes as the primary end point
    -  FIGARO-DKD  looked at CV outcomes as the primary end point 

- Q. Which patients were included in these trials?
    -  Albuminuria 30-300 with eGFR 25-90 - A2 + G1/G2/G3
    - Albuminuria >300 with eGFR - >60 - A3 + G1/G2

- Q. What was the duration of the follow-up of these patients?
    - It was 2-3 years 


- Q. What was the main driver of the CV benefit in the  Finerenone  group?
    - Reduction of hospitalization due to heart failure


- Q.  What were the renal end points studied?
    - 1. Kidney failure- defined as eGFR <15
    - 2. Sustained >40% reduction in eGFR from baseline
    - 3. Renal death 

- Q. How much potassium increase is expected?
    - 0.2 meq/l 


- Q. What is  FIDELITY study  ?
    - This was pooled analysis of the two studies 


- Q. What is the indication of  Finerenone  as per the  AACE  guideline ?
    - 1. Type 2 diabetes
    - 2. eGFR- >25
    - 3. UACR >30
    - 4. On maximum dose of RAAS blocker


- Q. What should be the baseline potassium level before starting  Finerenone ?
    - <4.8 - can start
    - 4.8-5.0- caution
    - More than 5.0- Not recommended

- Q.What should be the starting dose of  Finerenone ?
    - It is based on eGFR
        - <25- not recommended
        - 25-60- 10 mg OD
        - More than 60- 20 mg OD

- Q. How should the dose be monitored based on potassium levels?
    - Potassium on follow-up
        - <4.8- Can consider increasing to 20 mg if a patient is on 10 mg
        - 4.8-5.5 - continue the same dose (10 or 20 mg)
        - More than 5.5- stop treatment- restart if potassium <5.0

- Q. What are the 5 , '5s' for  Finerenone  therapy ?
    - initiate with eGFR >25
    - Initiate when potassium <5.0
    - With-hold when potassium >5.5
    - It reduces ESKD in 1 in 5 patients
    - It reduces heart failure risk in 1 in 5 patients
