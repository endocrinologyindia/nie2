- Q. Which drugs are considered first-line therapy for the management of patients with  Diabetic kidney disease?
    - 1. Metformin
    - 2. SGLT2i
    - 3. RAS blockade
    - 4. Statin
- Q. Which drugs are considered second-line therapy for  Diabetic kidney disease?
    - GLP-1 RA 
    - Anti-platelet drugs
    - non steroidal Mineralocorticoid receptor agonist -  Finerenone 
- Q. As per the new guidelines up to what eGFR category can the  SGLT2i  be used?
    -  SGLT2i  can be used initiated up to eGFR >20 
    - However, the drug can be continued in patients with type 2 diabetes, if the eGFR falls below this level
    - The only consideration for stopping this drug is when the patient requires dialysis
- Q. Which patients with diabetic kidney disease should not be given SGLT2i?
    - There is not enough data for:
    - 1. Type 1 diabetes
    - 2. Post-renal transplant
    - 3. Patients on dialysis
    - 4. eGFR <20 
        - at this eGFR SGLT2i should NOT be initiated, but if the patient is already on the drug and eGFR falls to this level it can be continued till the patient is started on dialysis 
- Q. Summarize some practical recommendations for initiating  SGLT2i  in  Diabetic kidney disease.
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2Fyp2Nlmzgsx.png?alt=media&token=8f965290-ae1a-432b-8aa1-8b0aedcbe33b)
- Q. Where does  GLP-1 receptor agonist stand in the equation?
    - It is considered the preferred second-line therapy in patients with  Diabetic kidney disease  for diabetes control, CV risk reduction, and weight loss
    - However, since it does not have a dedicated CKD trial, it misses out on Level A evidence
- Q. What are the indications for  Finerenone as per the current guideline?
    - 1. Type 2 diabetes
    - 2. eGFR- >25
    - 3. UACR >30
    - 4. On maximum dose of RAAS blocker
    - 5. Baseline potassium <4.8 (with caution up to <5.0)
- Q. Which is another non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor agonist other than  Finerenone under trial?
    - Esaxerenone
-  Q. Can  Finerenone  be used with  SGLT2i  ?
    - The benefit of the two seems complimentary
    - Also it seems  SGLT2i  mitigates the risk of  hypokalemia  in these patients 
- Q. In which cases is steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor agonist  (eg:  Spironolactone ) suggested?
    - If the patient has  Heart failure  and  Primary Aldosteronism 
    - In these cases, steroidal MRA is preferred over non-steroidal because of its proven benefits in these conditions
