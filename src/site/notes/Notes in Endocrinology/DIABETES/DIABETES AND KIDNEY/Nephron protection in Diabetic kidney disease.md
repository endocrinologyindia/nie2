- Q. Which are two important pathogenic mechanisms causing kidney disease in patients with diabetes ?
    - Glomerular hypertrophy
    - intraglomerular hypertension


- Q. What produces glomerular hyperfiltration?
    - It is mainly due to afferent arteriole vasodilatation
    - SGLT2 is increased in people with diabetes because of hyperglycemia  hence there is increase sodium reabsorption 
    - This causes afferent vasodilatation 
    - This further leads to Glomerular hyperfiltration
    - Glomerular hyperfiltration produces intraglomerular hypertension which leads to diabetic kidney disease
    - AGE, IGF1, sorbitol, ANP etc have similar role on afferent arterial vasodilatation.


- Q. Why does RAAS inhibitor protect the kidney?
    - ACEI / ARB cause vasodilatation of afferent and efferent arteriole, but efferent arterial vasodilatation is more than Afferent arterial vasodilatation 
    - Hence this reduce the glomerular filtration pressure and hence protects the kidney


- Q. Summarize the mechanism of renal damage in Diabetic nephropathy and how SGLT2 and ACEI protect the kidney? #Conceptual-Learning  ^[Anders HJ, Davis JM, Thurau K. Nephron protection in diabetic kidney disease. New England journal of medicine. 2016 Nov 24;375(21):2096-8.]
    - Step 1- Tubuloglomerular feedback
        - Reduced GFR → reduced flow rate in kidney → increase Na reabsorption → reduced Na reaching the Macula densa → macula densa signals release of renin → RAAS → angiotensin II → efferent vasoconstriction → increase of GFR
            - Angiotensin II produces both afferent and efferent Vasocontriction but efferent > afferent – hence the net increase of GFR
        - Vice versa occurs, if there is an increase of GFR
    - Step 2 – Hypefilteration in diabetics
        - People with diabetes have Glomerular hyperfiltration
        - This is because IGF1, AGE, sorbitol  afferent vasodilatation which increase GFR
        - Hence intact Tubuloglomerular feedback is required for normalizing GFR
    - Step 3 Role of glycosuria
        - In Diabetes there is an increase of glucose in urine hence SGLT2 is activated → to increase Sodium and glucose reabsorption → remember, more Na is reabsorbed →, so less Sodium to Macula densa → , so more Renin release !!
        - Already the GFR is high due to hyperfiltration and this adds fuel to the fire
        - So there is a loss of Tubuloglomerular feedback in diabetics
    - Step 4 – Fuel to the fire
        - Hypertension and loss of nephrons further increase pressure on the remaining nephron and increase GFR
        - Hence producing Intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy
    - Step 4 – Now for ACEI relief
        - ACEI provides noticeable relief by blocking the RAAS pathway preventing the increase of GFR caused by the renin system
    - Step 5- SGLT2i
        - SGLT2i inhibits sodium and glucose reabsorption and hence  keep the tubuloglomerular feedback intact!
        - Hence it is renoprotective
