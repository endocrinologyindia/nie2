- Q. What is the more appropriate term – Diabetic nephropathy or diabetic kidney disease?
    - Diabetic kidney disease is more appropriate since Diabetic nephropathy is a histopathological diagnosis


- Q. What are the major clinical manifestations of diabetic kidney disease?
    - Albuminuria
    - Progressive decline in renal function


- Q. Which are the stages of albuminuria?
    - Hyperfiltration- mainly in type 1 diabetes
    - Moderately increased albuminuria – previously called Microalbuminuria- 30 -300 mg/day
    - Severely increased albuminuria- previously called macroalbuminuria - >300 mg/day


- Q. Can non-albuminuric diabetic patients also have a decline in GFR?
    - Yes
    - This is more common in type 1 patients


- Q. Does hematuria occur in diabetic nephropathy?
    - Yes
    - It can occur in diabetic nephropathy
    - It is mainly microscopic hematuria
    - Sometimes it is because of other renal disorder associated
    - Sometimes red cell casts are also seen


- **Epidemiology **


- Q. How common is microalbumiuria in type 1 diabetics ?
    - 20-30% of type 1 diabetics with the duration of disease > 15 years have Microalbuminuria
    - 50% of these progress to progressive renal disease
    - Intensive glycemic control and use of ACEI /ARB have reduced the incidence of progressive renal disease and ESRD


- Q. In the intensive treatment arm of DCCT, how many developed overt nephropathy?
    - Only 2% developed creatinine of >2 mg/dl over follow up of 30 years with intensive glycemic control


- Q. Can macroalbumuniria and microalbuminuria regress ?
    - Yes, regression has been shown in DCCT trial with intensive glycemic control


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Alternate cause of renal disorder must be considered in patients who develop new-onset over nephropathy more than 20 years after the beginning of the disease


- Q. Do Type 2 diabetics have less renal disease than type 1 diabetics?
    - Yes
    - But maybe a function of the lesser duration of the disease
    - However, current data suggest that renal risk is equivalent


- **Pathology **


- Q. Which are the significant structural changes in diabetic kidney disease?
    - Mesangial expansion
    - Glomerular sclerosis
    - Glomerular basement membrane thickening


- Q. What is Kimmelsteil- Wilson syndrome ?
    - Nodular intercapillary glomerulosclerosis


- Q. What is the renal pathology society classification of diabetic nephropathy
    - Class I- basement membrane thickening only
    - Class II- Mesangial expansion
    - Class III- at least one nodular glomerulosclerosis and <50% global glomerulosclerosis
    - Class IV- >50% of global glomerulosclerosis


- Q. How much thickening of the basement membrane is considered significant?
    - Greater than 430 nm in males above nine years
    - GReater than 395 mm in females


- Q. What are other causes of nodular glomerulosclerosis?
    - Amyloidosis
    - Hypertension and metabolic syndrome without Diabetes
    - Chronic hypoxic condition like cyanotic heart disease


- **Pathogenesis **


- Q. What is the cause of glomerulosclerosis in a patient with diabetic nephropathy?
    - [[intraglomerular hypertension\|intraglomerular hypertension]] is the reason for glomerulosclerosis in a patient with diabetic nephropathy


- Q. What causes mesangial expansion?
    - Probably by hyperglycemia and increase AGE


- Q. Which biomarker has been linked with possible pathogenesis in diabetic nephropathy?
    - Prorenin
    - Increased level is seen in diabetic nephropathy
    - May increase MAPK pathway expression


- Q. Which Cytokine is associated with diabetic nephropathy?
    - TGF beta


- **RISK FACTORS **


- Q. What is the relation between glomerular hyperfiltration and risk of progression?
    - People with type 1 diabetes diagnosed < 5 years – some of them have glomerular hyperfiltration with GFR 25-50 above normal
    - This subgroup seems to have an increased risk of progression


- Q. Why do people with Diabetes have intraglomerular hypertension?
    - Intraglomerular hypertension is associated with increase glomerulosclerosis and progressive decline in renal function
    - Diabetes  impaired renal autoregulation → ideally systemic hypertension should cause renal vasoconstriction, which is absent in these cases → hence it causes intraglomerular  hypertension


- Q. Enlist the risk factors associated with diabetic nephropathy?
    - Genetic susceptibility
    - Race
    - Glycemic control
    - Oral contraceptive pills use
    - Obesity
    - Hypertension
    - Age and duration of Diabetes
    - Initial glomerular hyperfiltration in type 1


- Q. What is the correlation between diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy ?
	- In type 1 diabetes, most patients with diabetic nephropathy have retinopathy
	- Retinopathy often precedes nephropathy
	- However, patients with retinopathy do not necessarily have nephropathy
	- In type 2 diabetics- those who have Proteinuria + Retinopathy are more likely to have diabetic nephropathy, while those not having them are more likely to have other causes of nephropathy
	- Those who have Klimmesteil-Wilson syndrome features (nodules) are more likely to have associated retinopathy
	- Those having mesangiosclerosisis are less likely to have associated retinopathy
	- According to 2007 K/DOQI guidelines
		- Consider Diabetes as etiology of CKD – if retinopathy present + albuminuria
		- If above  are absent- consider other etiology for CKD


- **Nondiabetic renal disease **


- Q. Does any diabetic treatment have a relation with some other cause of nephropathy?
    - Porcine insulin may cause an immunological response which can lead to membranous nephropathy


- Q. When should other causes of renal failure be considered in diabetic patients?
    - Acute /subacute renal dysfunction
    - Proteinuria onset is <5 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes
    - Other systemic signs and symptoms
    - Nephropathy without retinopathy in type 1 and without retinopathy and proteinuria in type 2
    - Reduction in GFR by >30 % within 2-3 months of starting ACEI/ARB
    - Presence of active urine sediment


- Q. Which are the common nondiabetic cause of CKD in diabetic patients?
    - IgA nephropathy
    - Membranous nephropathy
    - Minimal change disease
    - FSGS
