- Q. What is Pituitary Apoplexy?  
    - Clinical syndrome caused by acute ischemic infarction or hemorrhage within a pituitary adenoma.  
    - Typically occurs in the setting of an existing pituitary adenoma.  
    - Leads to rapid expansion of the adenoma.  
    - Causes acute onset of symptoms like headache, visual impairment, ocular paresis, altered mental status, and hormonal dysfunction.  
    - Results from compression of the normal pituitary gland or the hypothalamus.  

- Q. Is it because of infarct or hemorrhage in the pituitary?  
    - Could be either.  

- Q. Can it be asymptomatic?  
    - The infarct or hemorrhage can be asymptomatic.  
    - However, it is not under the umbrella definition of Pituitary Apoplexy.  

- Q. Is Sheehan a form of pituitary apoplexy?  
    - Since Sheehan is subclinical, it does not fall under the said definition.  
    - However, it is also a form of pituitary infarction.  

- Q. Is it reported in which most common subtype of Pituitary Adenoma?  
    - It is most commonly reported in non-functioning pituitary adenomas.  
    - Among functional tumors, it is most common in prolactinomas.  

- Q. Can it also occur in conditions not associated with Pituitary Adenoma?  
    - Rarely, it can occur in the absence of a pituitary adenoma in conditions such as Rathke's cleft cysts, pituitary hyperplasia, or inflammatory lesions.  

- Q. What are the outcomes of pituitary apoplexy?  
    - Deterioration:  
        - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or cerebral vasospasm.  
    - Improvement:  
        - With sequelae: Pituitary insufficiency, neurological disorder, or visual deficit.  
        - Without sequelae.  

- Q. What are the precipitating factors?  
    - Angiographic procedures.  
    - Anticoagulants.  
    - Increase in blood pressure.  
    - Dopamine agonists.  
    - Pituitary dynamic testing.  
    - High dose of estrogens.  
    - Trauma.  
    - Bleeding disorders.  
    - Cardiac surgery.  
    - Increase in intracranial pressure.  

- Q. What are the pathophysiological reasons for pituitary apoplexy?  
    - Tumor outgrowing its blood supply.  
    - Superior hypophyseal artery compressing against the diaphragmatic sellae.  
    - Inferior hypophyseal artery entrapment against the diaphragmatic notch.  

- Q. Is there a change in the blood supply between a normal pituitary and that of an adenoma?  
    - Yes.  
    - Normal pituitary is supplied by the superior hypophyseal artery.  
    - However, when there is a pituitary tumor, the blood supply comes from the inferior hypophyseal artery.  
    - The latter blood vessel is more vulnerable to pressure changes.  

- Q. Enlist the clinical features of pituitary apoplexy.  
    - Headache.  
    - Visual disorders.  
    - Loss of consciousness.  
    - Cranial nerve involvement: 3rd, 4th, 6th, and V1.  
    - Focal neurological deficit: Due to internal carotid involvement in the cavernous sinus.  
    - Endocrine dysfunction.  

- Q. What is the typical headache seen in patients with pituitary apoplexy?  
    - It is frontal and retroorbital in nature.  
    - It is often severe and described as "thunderclap" or "worst ever" headache.  
    - This headache is frequently associated with nausea and vomiting.  

- Q. What are the features of 3rd nerve palsy?  
    - Ptosis.  
    - Loss of light and accommodation reflex.  
    - Eyeball is downward and outward.  
    - Pupil: Mid-dilated.  

- Q. Can it produce facial nerve palsy?  
    - Yes.  

- Q. What are the points in the pituitary apoplexy score?  
    - Consciousness:  
        - Normal – GCS 15: 0.  
        - Mild – GCS 8-14: 2.  
        - Severe – GCS <8: 4.  
    - Visual acuity:  
        - Normal: 0.  
        - Unilateral: 1.  
        - Bilateral: 2.  
    - Ocular paresis:  
        - Absent: 0.  
        - Present – Unilateral: 1.  
        - Bilateral: 2.  
    - Visual field defect:  
        - Absent: 0.  
        - Unilateral: 1.  
        - Bilateral: 2.  

- Q. What is the use of this score?  
    - The score is useful for conservatively managed patients.  
    - A score of ≥4 or an increasing score would suggest the need for surgical intervention.  

- Q. Can DI occur in pituitary apoplexy?  
    - Yes.  

- Q. In case of suspected apoplexy, what is done first – CT or MRI?  
    - CT is done first, as MRI cannot diagnose fresh blood early.  
    - MRI is more useful in the subacute setting (4 days to 1 month).  

- Q. How will blood appear in a CT scan in various time frames?  
    - Acute (0-10 days): Hyperdense (60-80 HU).  
    - Subacute (10-20 days): Isodense (40 HU).  
    - Chronic (>20 days): Hypodense (10 HU).  

- Q. What about MRI?  
    - In T1:  
        - Acute (<24 hours): Isointense.  
        - Subacute (3-5 days): Hyperintense.  
        - Chronic (>3 weeks): Hypointense.  

- Q. What suggests hemorrhage and necrosis in subacute MRI?  
    - In T1:  
        - Hyperintense: Hemorrhage.  
        - Hypointense: Necrosis.  

- Q. What is the importance of knowing the timing of the origin of symptoms?  
    - To determine the best imaging approach.  

- Q. Which imaging must be done when the patient presents with symptoms within 6 hours of origin?  
    - CT scan.  

- Q. What do you see in this picture?

**Management**  

- Q. Give the management guidelines for pituitary apoplexy.  
    - **Step 1.1 – Assessment:**  
        - Note the time of onset of symptoms:  
            - If <4 days: Go for a CT scan.  
            - If >4 days: Go for an MRI sella directly.  
        - Note the following features on clinical examination:  
            - Consciousness (GCS).  
            - Visual acuity.  
            - Visual field.  
            - Ocular paresis.  
        - Calculate the Pituitary Symptom Score.  
    - **Step 1.2 – Cortisol Management:**  
        - Collect a sample for cortisol.  
        - Start empirical corticosteroids if the following conditions are met:  
            - Loss of consciousness.  
            - Hemodynamic instability.  
            - Reduced visual acuity.  
            - Severe visual field defect.  
            - Lower cortisol documented previously.  
            - Patient already on glucocorticoid replacement.  
        - Hydrocortisone:  
            - 100 mg IV bolus followed by 50 mg IV every 6 hours OR  
            - 50 mg in 50 ml of normal saline at 4 ml/hr (4 mg/hr infusion) – continuous.  
        - If conditions for empirical hydrocortisone are not met:  
            - Send 8:00 am cortisol the next morning.  
            - If cortisol <20 µg/dl: Start hydrocortisone.  
    - **Step 2 – Conservative vs. Surgical Management:**  
        - Surgical management is considered in the following conditions:  
            - Loss of consciousness.  
            - Severe loss of visual acuity.  
            - Severe visual field defects.  
            - Pituitary Symptom Score ≥4.  
        - Timing of surgery: Must be done within 1 week.  
    - **Step 3.1 – Conservative Management:**  
        - Daily visual field and visual acuity monitoring.  
        - Hemodynamic monitoring and neurological status monitoring.  
    - **Step 3.2 – Surgical Management:**  
        - Transsphenoidal approach – preferred.  
    - **Step 4 – Postoperative Management:**  
        - Continue glucocorticoids postoperatively.  
        - Post-op day 3: Withhold hydrocortisone dose in the afternoon and evening, and check cortisol the next morning at 8:00 am.  
            - If cortisol >20 µg/dl: Discontinue glucocorticoids.  
            - If cortisol 14-20 µg/dl: Glucocorticoids only during stress.  
            - If cortisol <14 µg/dl: Glucocorticoids required.  
        - Thyroid function on day 3: If low, replace thyroid hormone.  
        - Visual assessment 48 hours after surgery: Bedside reassessment with perimetry at a later date.  
    - **Step 5 – Long-term Postoperative Management:**  
        - 6 weeks post-op: Reassess anterior pituitary function.  
        - MRI: 3 months after surgery, then annually for 5 years.  

- Q. How common is secondary adrenal insufficiency in patients with pituitary apoplexy?  
    - It is very common, found in about 70% of cases.  

- Q. What are the signs of secondary adrenal insufficiency?  
    - Hyponatremia.  
    - Hypoglycemia.  
    - Hypotension.  

- Q. When surgery is considered, how are the outcomes of various complications?  
    - Endocrine abnormalities: Recover in 2 weeks.  
    - Visual field defect: 8 weeks.  
    - Cranial nerve abnormality: 2 months.  

- Q. What is the importance of preoperative prolactin levels in predicting recovery of endocrine function?  
    - Preoperative prolactin levels >8.8 ng/ml predict a higher likelihood of recovery of endocrine function postoperatively.  

- Q. Give the difference in outcome in early surgery versus late surgery.  
    - **Improvement in Visual Deficits:**  
        - Early Surgery: 57% to 95% improvement.  
        - Late Surgery: No significant difference in visual outcomes.

        - Early Surgery: 63% to 100% improvement.  
        - Late Surgery: No significant difference.  
    - **Pituitary Function Recovery:**  
        - Early Surgery: 19% to 57% improvement.  
        - Late Surgery: No significant difference.  
    - **Recovery of Visual Acuity:**  
        - Early Surgery: Improvement in visual acuity.  
        - Late Surgery: No clear association with timing.  
    - **Timing of Surgery and Visual Field Deficits:**  
        - Early Surgery: Higher rate of improvement within 7 days.  
        - Late Surgery: Lower rate of improvement beyond 7 days.  
    - **General Considerations:**  
        - Early Surgery: Considered for substantial visual deficits after addressing electrolyte and hemodynamic abnormalities.  
        - Late Surgery: Selection bias in treatment decisions; outcomes must be interpreted with caution.  

- Q. Give the summary of data on surgery versus conservative management.  
    - **Surgical Decompression:**  
        - Historically recommended for rapid relief of symptoms.  
        - Improves visual deficits and cranial nerve palsies.  
        - Pituitary function recovery varies.  
    - **Conservative Management:**  
        - Similar outcomes in selected cases.  
        - Involves stabilization, hormonal replacement, and electrolyte correction.  
    - **Comparative Outcomes:**  
        - No definitive superiority of one approach over the other.  
    - **Factors Influencing Decision:**  
        - Severity of symptoms and complications.  
    - **Limitations in Data:**  
        - Further studies needed for better stratification.  

- Q. What percentage of patients have complete regression after conservative management?  
    - Complete regression is seen in 28% of cases, with a mean time of regression of 18 months.  

- Q. What percentage of patients have progression or recurrence?  
    - 20%.  

- Q. Does the recurrence or progression depend on whether surgery was done or conservative management was done?  
    - No.
