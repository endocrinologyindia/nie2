- Q. How common are aggressive pituitary tumors (APT) ?
    - 15% of pituitary adenoma
- Q. How common is pituitary carcinoma?
    - very rare - 0.1-0.4% of Pituitary adenoma
- Q. What is the definition of [[pituitary carcinoma\|pituitary carcinoma]] ?
    - Distant metastasis or metastasis beyond the craniospinal axis
- Q. At what age are they seen ?
    - generally in older people - in 5th decade and beyond
- Q. Which type of adenomas are more likely to be aggressive ?
    - Corticotroph adenoma
    - Lactotroph adenoma
- Q. What is an important point in history that correlates with aggressive pituitary tumor (APT)?
    - Headache
    - Presence of headache in pituitary tumor is because of 
        - Highly proliferative tumors
        - Cavernous sinus invasion
        - presence of somatotroph adenomas 
- Q. Are they more common in [[MEN1\|MEN1]] syndrome ?
    - Yes
- Q. Is there any specific definition or diagnostic criteria for APT ?
    - No
    - There is a general definition given by ESE which is 
        - "PAs that demonstrate radiological invasiveness and an unusually rapid tumor growth rate, or clinically relevant tumor growth despite optimal standard treatments in the form of surgery, radiotherapy, and conventional medical therapies"
- Q. What percentage growth can be considered rapid ?
    - More than 20% increase of maximum diameter of the pituitary adenoma over 12 months is considered rapid growth 
- Q. Clinically based on response to treatment, what is considered APT ?
    - Progression or recurrence of tumor after radiotherapy is considered to be important marker of APT
- Q. Based on immunohistochemistry, how do you define APT ?
    - Ki-67 index >3%
    - elevated mitotic index

- Q. What is the criteria based on MRI to consider a Pituitary adenoma as invasive ?
    - Knosp grade 3 and 4 correlates with radiological invasion
- Q. What is the Knosp's criteria ?
    - The Knosp criteria is a classification system for pituitary tumors based on their invasiveness into surrounding structures, specifically the cavernous sinus. The criteria is based on the tumor's size, location, and degree of invasion, and ranges from grade 0 (no invasion) to grade 4 (complete invasion). This classification is used to help guide treatment decisions for pituitary tumors.
- Q. How is the size of Pituitary adenoma best determined on serial scans ?
    - The largest diameter is to be considered on 1 Dimension
    - This correlates with size on 3D 
- Q. What is the ideal classification system to use for Cavernous sinus invasion ?
    - Knosp classification of cavernous sinus invasion 
    - ![](https://operativeneurosurgery.com/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=knosp.jpg)
    - Grade 0 - adenoma does not extend the medial carotid line.
    - Grade 1 - adenoma extends the medial line, but doesn't reach the median line, so-called “intercarotid” line.
    - Grade 2 - tumor extends beyond the median line, but doesn't extend beyond or tangent to the lateral line.
    - Grade 3
        - 3A - the tumor extends to the lateral line superiorly (over ICA)
        - 3B - the tumor extends to the lateral line inferiorly (under ICA)
    - Grade 4 - The tumor totally wraps around the intracavernous carotid artery
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FPqHEjz6_Az.png?alt=media&token=5eb318d2-ef3f-4b50-b8bb-31adb82cad43)
- Q. On a Knosp classification, when do you say for certain that cavernous sinus is invaded ?
    - You say this when the tumor cross the outer border of the carotid artery present in the cavernous sinus 
    - This is grade 3 or greater as per the Knosp classification 
- [[Real life cases\|Real life cases]]
    - Patient with recurrent pituitary adenoma with Knosp classification of Grade 3C

- Q. What is MRI volumetric analysis
    - MRI volumetric analysis is a technique used to measure the volume of different structures in the brain or other organs using MRI imaging. It involves processing MRI images to create a 3D reconstruction of the region of interest and then using specialized software to segment the image into different structures or regions. By measuring the volume of these structures, researchers or clinicians can quantify changes in size over time or compare volumes between different individuals or groups

- Q. Is [[Pasireotide\|Pasireotide]] more effective than first generation somatostatin analgoues ?
    - Yes
    - Pasireotide is a more effective second generation somatostatin analogue than first generation somatostatin analogues in treating acromegaly and Cushing's disease, and is more effective in normalizing IGF-I and GH levels and reducing tumour volume in acromegaly, and is more effective in normalizing UFC levels in Cushing's disease. 
    - Pasireotide is also more effective in reducing tumour size in thyrotroph tumours.
    - Prolactinoma do not respond to first generation agent but may respond to Pasireotide
- Q. What is the difference between Pasireotide and standard first generation somatostain analogues in terms of their action of somatostain receptors ?
    - Pasireotide binds to multiple somatostatin receptors, including SSTR2A and SSTR5, while standard first generation somatostatin analogues only bind to SSTR2A. 
- Q. Which is a chemotherapeutic drug used for aggressive pituitary tumor ?
    - [[Temozolomide\|Temozolomide]] has been used in various case series for aggressive pituitary tumor

    - 1. Fatigue is the most common side effect
    - 2. LFT monitoring must be done
    - 3. Nausea and vomiting may occur- so anti-emetic may be prescribed during the fist cycle
    - 4. Hematological monitoring is required- Myelosupression may occur 
- Q. Can [[Temozolomide\|Temozolomide]] be combined with Radiotherapy ?
    - Yes. 
    - This is called the "Stupp protocol"
    - Initially the drug is given in dose of 75 mg/m2/day along with 6 weeks of EBRT
    - The logic is that the drug improves the response to radiotherapy
    - This is followed by the standard regimen of 150-200mg/m2- for 5 days every 28 days for 6 months
- Q. How long is Temozolomide given in patients with aggressive pituitary adenoma ?
    - Treatment should be continued for at least 3-6 months, and should be stopped if there is progressive disease or serious adverse events occur.
    - Typical duration is 12 months 
    - In ESE survey treatment has been given for often for mean of 9 month to upto 36 month in some cases
- Q. What happens after stopping  Temozolomide therapy ?
    - After stopping Temozolomide, there is often a period of sustained remission with a median time to progression of 12 months. 
    - Patients receiving more than 12 months of TMZ achieved a median relapse-free survival of 57 months compared with 18 months in those receiving less than 12 cycles.
- Q. What are the determinants of the response to Temozolomide ?
    - The determinants of the response to Temozolomide include the MGMT status, the presence of mutations in the mTOR pathway, the expression of ErbB receptors, and the type of pituitary tumor or carcinoma
- Q. What is the relationship between MGMT expression and response to Temozolomide ?
    - Low MGMT expression is associated with a positive response to Temozolomide, while high MGMT expression is associated with a lack of response. 
- Q. How is the MGMT expression determined ? 
    - MGMT expression is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers of pituitary tissue by experienced neuropathologist
- Q. What are the treatment options for atypical pituitary tumor beyond Temozolomide (TMZ) ?
    - Treatment options for atypical pituitary tumors beyond Temozolomide (TMZ) include everolimus therapy, lapatinib therapy, EGFR/ErbB2-targeting lapatinib therapy, mTOR pathway STK11(F298L) mutation, and ErbB receptor expression targeting.

- Q. What is the overall prognosis of patients with APT ?
    - The overall prognosis of patients with APT is difficult to determine due to the variable course of the disease and the lack of data on long-term outcomes. Generally, APT is associated with a worse prognosis than PA, with a higher rate of recurrence and a greater risk of metastasis. However, some APTs may respond well to standard treatments and never exhibit aggressiveness.
- Q. What is the importance of the somatic expression of ATRX gene in APT ?
    - ATRX is important in APT because it is a gene that is associated with aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary carcinomas. 
    - Mutations in the ATRX gene can lead to the development of these tumors, and understanding the role of ATRX in APT can help researchers develop better treatments for these tumors.
    - Somatic variants of ATRX as seen in 1/5th of APT 
    - This may be exploited as an IHC marker in the future
- Q. What in the new radiotracer that has been found to be used in pituitary tissue tracing ?
    - C11 Methionine is a specific tracer of pituitary tissue
    - It is more specific than FDG-PET
    - It may play an important role in future
- Q. What is an alternative terminology suggested for Pituitary adenoma ?
    - It is suggested that pituitary adenomas should be called "Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors" instead
