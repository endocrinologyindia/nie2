- Q. What is the definition of Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA)?
    - Stiles et al. define FIPA as "A term used to identify a genetic condition with pituitary tumors without other endocrine or other associated abnormalities." ^[Ref: Stiles CE, Korbonits M. Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenoma. [Updated 2020 May 28]. In: Feingold KR, Anawalt B, Boyce A, et al., editors. Endotext [Internet]. South Dartmouth (MA): MDText.com, Inc.; 2000-. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278949/]
    
- Q. Name the various germline mutation seen with Pituitary tumors?
    - MEN – Menin (MEN1), CDKN1B (MEN4)
    - FIPA  - AIP,  GPR101 (XLAG)
    - SDH related pituitary adenoma- SDHA, B,  C, D
    - Carney’s complex related- PRKAR1A
    - Neurofibromatosis – NF1
    - Pituitary blastoma- DICER1


- Q. What are two broad categories of Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA)?
    - FIPA with AIP mutation
    - FIPA without AIP mutation


- Q. What is fullform of AIP ?
    - Aryl hydrocarbon interacting protein


- Q. What was the basis of the origin of FIPA?
    - In a search to identify tumors of the pituitary not having MEN1 or Carney’s complex lead to the discovery of FIPA


- Q. What is homogenous FIPA, and what is heterogenous FIPA?
    - Homogenous FIPA- same pituitary tumor syndrome amongst family members
    - Heterogenous FIPA – different pituitary tumor syndromes


- Q. Describe the frequency of various pituitary tumors in FIPA?
    - Prolactinoma- 37%
    - Somatotropinoma – 35%
    - NFPA -14%
    - Somatolactotropinoma – 6.4%
    - Cushing’s disease 2.9%
    - Less than 1-2% :
        - gonadotropinoma
        - Plurihormonal
        - thyrotropinoma


- Pearl
    - Prevalence of prolactinoma compared to the general population is slightly lower
    - However, it is still the most common
    - Somatoropinoma has a much higher prevalence compared to the normal population


- Q. Loss of heterogenicity in which region has been associated with somatotropinoma in the general population?
    - LOH in 11q13 is commonly associated with somatotropinoma


- Q. What is the penetrance of AIP mutation?
    - Variable penetrance – 20%


- Q. Does pituitary adenoma with AIP mutation occur at a younger age?
    - Yes


- Q. Is gigantism more common with AIP mutation?
    - Yes


- Q. Is [[Non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA)\|Non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA)]] in FIPA more aggressive?
    - Yes


- Pearl
    - Pituitary adenomas with FIPA are
    - Occur at a younger age
    - More aggressive
    - Poor response to treatment
    - Larger size
    - Even within FIPA, those with positive AIP mutation have more significant of the above features compared to AIP negative ones


- Q. Are AIP mutations germline or somatic?
    - Germline only


- Pearl
    - FIPA – overall – prolactinoma most common
    - FIPA with AIP mutation – Somatotropinoma is most common


- Q. AIP mutation is more common in males or females?
    - More in males


- Q. Is pituitary apoplexy more common in AIP patients?
    - Yes


- Q. Are somatoropinomas with AIP mutation relatively resistant to treatment with Somatostatin analogs?
    - Yes


- Q. What is the mode of inheritance?
    - It is autosomal dominant


- Q. What % of pituitary adenoma are FIPA?
    - 2-3%


- Q. What is the role of the AIP gene?
    - Exact role is not known
    - But studies in mice have shown that AIP -/- tend to die in-utero because of defective cardiac development
    - When Aip +/- develop a disease similar to humans – aggressive somatotropinoma


- Q. How common is AIP mutation in FIPA patients?
    - 25% of FIPA patients have AIP mutation


- Q. What is the difference in patients of FIPA with AIP mutation and without?

- Q. Give an outline for genetic testing in a patient with Pituitary adenoma?

	- *please read as XLAG instead of XLAq (Apologies for the typo)
- Q.What are the tests done in patients screened to be AIP mutation-positive?
    - Baseline
        - History, signs and symptoms, clinical examination
        - Baseline pituitary hormones
        - IGF1 and oGTT (for Growth hormone)
        - Baseline MRI
