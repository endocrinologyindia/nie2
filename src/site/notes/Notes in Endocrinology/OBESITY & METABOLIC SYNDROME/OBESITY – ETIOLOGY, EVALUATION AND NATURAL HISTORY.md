- Q. Give the cutoff for obesity in Adults?
    - Normal weight - BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2
    - Overweight - BMI ≥25 to 29.9 kg/m2
    - Obesity - BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2
    - Severe obesity - BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 (or ≥35 kg/m in the presence of comorbidities)
- Q. What is the cutoff for Asians?

    - Sleep restriction (and not sleep lengthening) is associated with obesity
    - Sleep restriction is also associated with reduced leptin and increased Ghrelin leading to increased food intake

- Q. What is restrained eating?
    - Many people have conscious control over their food intake
    - This is called restrained eating

- Q. Which antidepressant produces weight loss?
    - Buproprion

    - Weight gain Carbamazepine and valproate
    - Weight loss- Topiramate, Zonisamide

    - PCOS
    - Hypogonadism
    - Pseudohypoparathyroidism
    - GH deficiency
- Q. What is the cause of obesity in Cushing’s syndrome?
    - Increase glucocorticoids  increase 11 beta HSD1 in visceral tissue → increase lipogenesis → increase obesity
- Q. Is hypothyroidism associated with obesity?
    - Mild weight gain is common in hypothyroidism
    - However, it is in the tune of 1-2 kg
- Q. Does treatment of Subclinical hypothyroidism produce weight gain?
    - No
- **Other etiologies **
- Q. What is seasonal affective disorder?

    - This can be corrected by exposure to light
    - This may be related to obesity
    - Can be treated with SSRI
- Q. Which viral infection has been linked with obesity?
    - Adenovirus infection
- Q. What is the  EOSS score?
    - This is the Edmonton Obesity staging system
- Q. Why is there a need for an EOSS score when we have  BMI?
    - This is because BMI correlates poorly with some of the health outcomes
    - EOSS score takes more factors into consideration beyond BMI
    - For the same BMI- different patients may have different EOSS scores and hence different outcomes
- Q. Give the outline for the EOSS staging system.

- Q. Give the EOSS staging in simple terms.
    - 0 - No comorbidities or distress due to obesity
    - 1-  Mild preclinical morbidities due to obesity
        - Borderline hypertension

        - Impaired fasting glucose
    - 2- Established comorbidities
        - Hypertension
        - Diabetes
        - OSA
    - 3. - End organ damage
        - Myocardial infarction
        - Stroke
    - 4. Severe obesity-related issues
- Q. How does one define an EOSS score?
    - So you say Class I, Stage 0 Obesity - which means a class I based on BMI and stage 0 based on EOSS score
- Q. What treatment would you propose at what stage of obesity?
    - Stage 0 and 1 - lifestyle measures (LSM)
    - Stage 2- LSM and Pharmacological therapy
    - Stage 3-4 - LSM, Pharmacotherapy, and surgery

    - 2.The cut-offs for WC for initiating pharmacotherapy was unanimously agreed upon as a WC measurement 10 cms more than the upper limit of gender specific normal value for adult Asian Indians.
