- **SEMAGLUTIDE**

---

- **Q.** How do  GLP-1 receptor agonists  produce weight loss?
    - GLP-1 Receptor agonists produce weight loss by slowing gastric emptying to slow glucose entry into the general circulation, inhibiting food intake, reducing abdominal and hepatic fat deposition, improving β-cell function, and increasing insulin sensitivity.
    - GLP1 RA acts on the central nervous system, specifically on AgRP (agouti-related peptide), CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript), NPY (neuropeptide Y), and POMC (proopiomelanocortin).

---

- **Q.** Do  GLP-1 receptor agonists  act on the hypothalamus?
    - Yes, GLP-1RA acts on the hypothalamus. GLP-1RA has been shown to affect appetite, satiety, hunger, and food preferences, which are all regulated by the hypothalamus.

---

- **Q.** What is  nucleus accumbens ?
    - The nucleus accumbens is a brain region located in the basal forebrain, near the septum. It is part of the mesolimbic reward system and is associated with pleasure, motivation, and reward-related behavior.
    - Recent evidence suggests that the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) neuronal projection to the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) contributes to food intake control.

---

    - SELECT TRIAL

---

- **Q.** Tell me about the STEP 1 trial?
    - The STEP 1 trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of semaglutide at the higher dose of 2.4 mg/week for promoting weight loss in obese or overweight people with related comorbidities, but not diabetes.
    - The trial involved 1961 participants and was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in early 2021.
    - The findings revealed an average 14.9% reduction in body weight from baseline during 68 weeks of treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg plus a lifestyle intervention, compared with just a 2.4% reduction in the placebo plus lifestyle intervention group.
    - In total, 86.4% of the semaglutide group lost at least 5% of their body weight, and adverse effects were in line with those expected for the medication class.
    - The STEP 1 trial demonstrated that semaglutide may be an effective treatment for weight loss.

---

- **Q.** What about the STEP 2 trial?
    - This compared 1 mg semaglutide to 2.4 mg semaglutide in obese diabetics.

---

- **Q.** Then the STEP 3 and 4 trials?
    - These were conducted on obese people with comorbidities, but not having diabetes.
    - The comparator was a placebo.

---

- **Q.** What about the STEP 5 trial?
    - This looked at sustained weight loss in non-diabetics.
    - Patients were followed up for 2 years.

---

- **Q.** What about the STEP 6 trials?
    - This was for the Asian population.

---

- **Q.** Then STEP 8?
    - Compared Semaglutide to Liraglutide.

---

---

- **NEWER DRUGS**

---

- **Q.** What are the areas in which potential new drugs for obesity are being developed?
    - Potential new drugs for obesity management are currently being researched and developed. These drugs may target the underlying neurohormonal dysregulations that cause weight gain and prevent sustained weight loss. They may also aim to reduce inflammatory and pro-thrombotic markers, as well as chronic disease incidence. Additionally, they may be designed to reduce the anorexigenic hormone leptin and increase the orexigenic hormone ghrelin, in order to create a physiologic environment conducive to sustained weight loss.

---

- **Q.** What is cagrilintide?
    - Cagrilintide is a peptide analogue developed by Novo Nordisk for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is part of a family of GLP1R agonists, which are drugs that act on the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor to improve glycemic control and reduce body weight.

---

- **Q.** What is the mechanism of action of cagrilintide?
    - Cagrilintide is a GLP1R/GcgR co-agonist that works by stimulating the release of insulin and glucagon, two hormones that help regulate blood sugar levels. It also helps reduce appetite and increase satiety, leading to weight loss.
