- Q. Give a broad outline of the terms NAFLD, NAFL, NASH
	- ![CleanShot 2023-01-11 at 07.40.49@2x.png](/img/user/attachments/CleanShot%202023-01-11%20at%2007.40.49@2x.png)
- Q. What is NAFLD?
    - (1) Evidence of hepatic steatosis (HS), either by imaging or histology
    - (2) lack of secondary causes of hepatic fat accumulation such as significant alcohol consumption, long-term use of a steatogenic medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders.
    - (3) no significant alcohol consumption (defined as ongoing or recent alcohol consumption of >21 drinks/week for men and >14 drinks/week for women)
- Q. What is NASH?
    - NAFLD is subdivided into the nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
    - NAFL, hepatic steatosis is present without evidence of significant inflammation
    - NASH, hepatic steatosis is associated with hepatic inflammation that may be histologically indistinguishable from alcoholic steatohepatitis
- Q. How do you differentiate NASH from NAFL?
    - Liver biopsy is the only method to differentiate  NAFL  from  NASH  #ClinicalPearl
- Q. What is  MAFLD?
    - Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)
    -  Recently, based on insights gained from the past two decades, an international panel of experts from 22 countries has taken the initiative to propose a new name and definition for NAFLD in adult individuals - that is, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease . 
    - Idea is to make it a diagnosis of inclusion rather than the diagnosis of exclusion
- Q. Give the direction in which the etiology for transplant is moving.

- Applying Wilson and Junger criteria for nash/NAFLD screening
- Q. The condition sought should be an important health problem. Is NAFLD an important health problem?
    - Yes
    - NASH is 2nd most common etiology for Liver transplant and will be number one soon.
    - Risk of Liver cancer is increased 2 folds in patients with NAFLD
- Q. What is the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes?
    - Depending on the screening methodology used, as much as 65-70% of patients with Type 2 Diabetes have NAFLD
- Q. There should be an accepted treatment for patients with recognized diseases. Can we prevent the progression of Fibrosis in patients with NASH?
    - Yes
    - Drugs like Pioglitazone, Empagliflozin, and Liraglutide have been shown to prevent the progression of fibrosis in NASH
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FTMqWVvioqU.png?alt=media&token=8d9537aa-f714-4404-b54c-5743300cbf59)
    - Weight loss is an effective option for preventing progress in patients with NASH.
- Q. How do we screen for NAFLD/NASH?
    - 2/3rd of patients with NAFLD/NASH have normal liver enzymes
        - Typically ALT >AST
        - Newer Cut-offs are 30 in males and 19 in females
    - USG shows increased echogenicity
    - A meta-analysis found that the sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound were 85 and 94 percent, respectively, when using liver biopsy as the gold standard
    - The fatty liver index (FLI), is an algorithm based on waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) used for recognizing fatty liver
        - Cutoff of 30 has a sensitivity of 87%
        - Cutoff of 60 has a specificity of 86%
    - Other tests like Transient elastography, MR spectroscopy, MR elastography, and liver biopsy are more useful for the assessment of fibrosis rather than mere screening
- Q. Does the AST/ALT (SGOT/SGPT) ratio help in the diagnosis of NASH?
    - AST/ALT ratio in  NASH/NAFLD  is <1 (SGOT/SGPT)  while in Alcoholic liver disease, it is more than 2 
- Q. Does the degree of ALT elevation correlate with the severity of the disease?
    - the degree of AST/ALT elevation does not correlate with the severity of the disease
- Q What happens to the ALP levels?
    -  ALP  may be elevated 2-3 times the ULN
- Q. What is the importance of serum ferritin levels in this disease?
    - Serum  ferritin  has an important role in  NASH/NAFLD  #ClinicalPearl  
        - Value >1.5 times the ULN is likely to be associated with greater progression of the liver disease 
- Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for MAFLD ?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F_mIEPhBkOn.png?alt=media&token=7288940f-c85b-4ec4-8331-e53271926637)
- Q.  Do we have an early stage here?
    - Yes. NASH is an early precursor of Cirrhosis or End stage liver disease which is what we are trying to prevent.
    - There should be a suitable test or examination and the test should be acceptable to the population
    - Liver enzymes and ultrasound are acceptable tests for the population
- Q. Upto what stage can the disease be reversed?
    - Upto the Fibrosis stage 
- Q. The natural history of the condition, including development from latent to declared disease, should be adequately understood. Do we understand the natural history of NAFLD/NASH?

- Q. There should be an agreed policy on whom to treat as patients. What to do once NAFLD is recognized?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FmGPk3GWK0I.png?alt=media&token=aa14aba6-2071-410b-b19d-be51eae4a626)
- FIBROSIS BIOMARKERS AND SCORES
- Q. Is screening for NAFLD cost-effective?
    - NAFLD is a reversible condition, particularly in the early stages.
    - Failing to detect the disease at an early stage can have detrimental clinical effects for some high-risk patients who are in danger of developing liver cirrhosis and related complications such as jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
    - NAFLD was considered cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained.
    - Fatty liver index is the most cost-effective screening test

        -  Hepatitis B 
        - Pneumococcal vaccine 
    - Weight loss - 0.5-1 kg/week
    -  Biopsy proven NASH and fibrosis with stage ≥2 and not having diabetes - Vitamin E - 800 IU/day (C. EVION- 400 IU - twice a day)   
    - Diabetes patients
        -  Metformin 
        -  Pioglitazone 
        -  Liraglutide 
    - If after weight loss - repeat ALT/AST after 3 months
        - if it has not come to normal - look for other causes 
- Q. Give some important notes on weight loss and  NASH/NAFLD.
    - Weight loss to be done to the tune of 0.5- 1 kg/week
    - weight loss can reverse all stages except  cirrhosis 
    - Liver function test can be normal in 30% of patients with  NASH/NAFLD  #ClinicalPearl
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F5HK92ZTJTn.jpg?alt=media&token=e82203f1-5ef8-4349-9c1f-b9c9935714e0)
- Q. In which cases is Pharmacotherapy used?
    - Early ­stage NASH at high risk for disease progression (age > 50 years, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or increased ALT)
    - Active NASH with high necroinflammatory activities
    - Progressive NASH (brid­ging fibrosis and cirrhosis)
- Q. What is the main purpose of any medication used?
    - It should be able to prevent the fibrosis stage
    - This can be gauged by a reduction of the NAS score (NAFLD Activity score)

    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FLRUI0aJdKw.png?alt=media&token=548bb470-d891-4879-bdcd-3ef3cb578b4c)
- Q. Is  Saroglitazar approved in India for use in  NASH/NAFLD?
    - Yes
- Q. What is the mechanism of action of  Saroglitazar?
    - Saroglitazar is a dual PPAR α and γ agonist and through activation of these transcriptional factors PPAR α & γ :
        - Reduces TG (predominantly through PPAR α agonism)
        - Reduces Insulin resistance and controls blood sugar level (predominantly through PPAR γ agonism)
- Q. How does  Saroglitazar compare with other drugs like OCA and UDCA?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FNkXgs4MApu.25.43%402x.png?alt=media&token=552548c2-7104-4aed-b2b7-c271b9936702)
- Q. Does  Saroglitazar reduce (NAFLD Activity score)?
    - Yes 
- Q. What is the role of  Semaglutide in  NASH/NAFLD?
    - This is from a trial published in the  NEJM 
        - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common disease that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but treatment options are limited. The efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide in patients with NASH are not known
        -  This phase 2 trial involving patients with NASH showed that treatment with semaglutide resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with NASH resolution than placebo.  
        -  However, the trial did not show a significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients with an improvement in fibrosis stage  

- Q. What is the most common cause of death in patients with  NASH/NAFLD?
    - The most common cause of death in patients with NASH/NAFLD is heart disease - need to screen and monitor for the same

- Q. What is  MAFLD?
    - Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)
    - "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of liver disease in many parts of the world, causing considerable liver-related (steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extra-hepatic morbidity and mortality (mainly cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease or certain types of extra-hepatic cancers). 
    -  Recently, based on insights gained from the past two decades, an international panel of experts from 22 countries has taken the initiative to propose a new name and definition for NAFLD in adult individuals - that is, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease . 
    - This proposed change in nomenclature is not simply a semantic revision, but may facilitate improved diagnosis of this common liver disease for health promotion, case identification, patient awareness, ongoing clinical trials, and health services delivery"
    - Until now the exclusion of other chronic liver diseases, including “excess” alcohol intake, was necessary for the diagnosis of MAFLD. 
    - As the pathogenic process leading to MAFLD is now better understood and is seen to originate from an underlying state of systemic metabolic dysfunction, MAFLD is perceived as a standalone disease that warrants a positive diagnosis, rather than a “none”-disease rubric. 
    - Moreover, the rising prevalence of MAFLD makes its coexistence with other chronic liver diseases quite possible, further negating a diagnosis based on the exclusion of concomitant diseases. 
    -  It is therefore our belief that this disease needs to be defined by its own set of positive criteria, rather than by exclusion criteria. 
    - > Idea is to make it a diagnosis of inclusion rather than the diagnosis of exclusion
    - 
- Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for MAFLD ?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F_mIEPhBkOn.png?alt=media&token=7288940f-c85b-4ec4-8331-e53271926637)

- Q. What is  Hepatic hypothyroidism?
    - [Effects of Resmetirom on Noninvasive Endpoints in a 36‐Week Phase 2 Active Treatment Extension Study in Patients With NASH - PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034581/)
        - Evidence suggests that NASH may be, in part, a condition of diminished liver thyroid hormone levels or hepatic hypothyroidism and that the incidence of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism is higher in patients with NAFLD/NASH relative to age‐matched controls. Tag:  NASH/NAFLD;  NASH

    - 2. It is not recommended for pediatric patients
    - 3. It is less reliable for ages <35 years
    - 4. For ages > 65 years- a higher cutoff of 1.9-2.0 is suggested in place of 1.3 
- Q. Which is a good confirmatory test?
    - Transient elastography 
- Q. What are the cut-off used in transient elastography?
    - <8.0 kPA- has good negative predictive value to rule out advanced fibrosis- ≥ F3/F4 levels 
    - More than 12 KPA - must be referred to a hepatologist
- Q. Which test has good use in early fibrosis?
    - MR elastography
