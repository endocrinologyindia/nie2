 - Q. What is the essential argument of bariatric surgery in terms of weight loss strategy  ?
    - The body has a metabolic set point and tries to maintain the same
    - Those on caloric restrictive diets- loose weight initially and acutely the set-point is lowered. 
    - But as soon as their fast period stop â†’ the set points goes to normal (even supranormal) and the patient starts to regain weight gain often overtaking the original weight
    - the problem with pharmacotherapy is that is only works on one physiological aspect which the body often overcomes 
    - [[bariatric surgery\|bariatric surgery]] surgery works because it changes local anatomy as well as physiology on several aspects leading to a multiprong apporach 

- Q. Which are the areas bypassed in [[RYGB\|RYGB]] surgery ?
    - part of stomach
    - Whole of duodenum
    - Proximal Jejunum
- Q. Which neurotransmitters in brain promote food intake and which promote satiety ?
    - AgRP - Promotes food intake
    - POMC- Promotes satiety

- Q. Do patients change food preference after [[bariatric surgery\|bariatric surgery]] ?
    - yes
    - they prefer less energy dense and sweet food
    - infact this occurs ealy on after surgery
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F-aSJ7RAtBG.png?alt=media&token=4d36804d-6797-4569-8cef-5a7b13c72ebb)
- Pearls:
    - Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the rewarding aspects of food is reduced after [[bariatric surgery\|bariatric surgery]] especially [[RYGB\|RYGB]]
    - The rate of salivation depends on the taste of food
    - Orofacial response in animal models is good indicator of whether they find food tasty or not
    - There is changes in taste after bariatric surgery
    - In initially few weeks after surgery there is craving for increased sugar and fat but this goes away 
        - Probably becauser the reward aspect of the food goes away 
    - [[Dumping syndrome\|Dumping syndrome]] also contributes to this food selection
        - increased glycemic load of food increases dumping syndrome
        - This is lost following bariatric surgery 
    - Taste changes occurs with [[RYGB\|RYGB]] and [[Sleeve gastrectomy\|Sleeve gastrectomy]] but not with adjustable gastric banding
    - Brown adipose tissue and rest energy expenditure changes are not certain following surgery
- Q. Which are the two most important gut hormones involved in the [[bariatric surgery\|bariatric surgery]] ?
    - [[GLP-1\|GLP-1]]
    - [[PYY\|PYY]]
    - Both are secreated by the [[L cells\|L cells]] of the pancreas
    - Both are elevated post-prandially after surgery
    - Fasting concentration do not change
    - both are anorexiogenic hormones which act centrally by crossing the blood brain barrier
    - [[RYGB\|RYGB]] the food reaches jejunum and ileum directly - there the L cells are most abandunt and they are stimulated leading to the release of these hormones
    - However, mice models have shown that though these mechanisms are helpful- they do not work in isolation

- Q. Does [[Sleeve gastrectomy\|Sleeve gastrectomy]] also have an impact on the [[L cells\|L cells]] ?
    - yes
    - [[Sleeve gastrectomy\|Sleeve gastrectomy]] produces rapid gastric emptying
    - Because of this more amount of nutrients get dumped into the jejunum and ileum more rapidly
    - However, the release of the hormones is less compared to RYGB
- Q. Which two new hormones are now considered to be playing an important role
    - [[Oxyntomodulin\|Oxyntomodulin]]
        - This is a dual [[GLP-1\|GLP-1]] and [[glucagon\|glucagon]] agonist
        - Reduces food intake and produces satiety
        - ![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2212877813001294-gr2.jpg)
    - [[Glicentin\|Glicentin]]
        - Exact mechanism is not not
        - It is the most stable of the proglucagon peptides hence may prove to be a good biomarker for [[L cells\|L cells]] function in future
    - Both are released by the [[L cells\|L cells]]
    - Levels of both are increased post surgery 
- Q. Give us a breakdown of the [[Proglucagon\|Proglucagon]] peptides 
    - ![Figure 1. %5BTissue specific processing of proglucagon...%5D. - Endotext - NCBI  Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279127/bin/glucagon-physiology-Image001.jpg)
- Q. What happens to [[Ghrelin\|Ghrelin]] ?
    - Little changes after [[RYGB\|RYGB]]
    - Reduces after [[Sleeve gastrectomy\|Sleeve gastrectomy]]
- Q. Are [[bile acid\|bile acid]] levels increased after obesity surgery ?
    - Yes
- Q. What is the impact of bile acid on weight loss ?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FylppFnEH3B.jpeg?alt=media&token=de1239f5-da66-4bf6-ab37-28d1a3dd2700)
- Q. Are bile acids increased following weight loss following lifestyle measures?
    - Bile acids, [[FGF19\|FGF19]] and [[GLP-1\|GLP-1]] and [[PYY\|PYY]] are reduced following Lifestyle measure induced weight loss
    - Hence the weight loss does not sustain
- Q. What is the role of [[FXR\|FXR]] in weight loss ?
    - [[FXR\|FXR]] induces browing of adipose tissue
    - Bile acid stimulate FXR 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FCbIwdWFCt0.png?alt=media&token=48c68cbd-7dfa-4c66-a64f-d63e1c565a9c)
- Q. What are the two types of FGR which increase following obesity surgery ?
    - [[FGF19\|FGF19]] and [[FGF21\|FGF21]]
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FgB4WuIKM8m.jpeg?alt=media&token=5a3d8255-16ea-42d9-96d5-6943a841efaa)
- Q. Which genetic cause of obesity responds well to [[bariatric surgery\|bariatric surgery]] ?
    - [[MC4R\|MC4R]] mutation
- Q. Which 2 gut microbes are strongly associated with obesity ?
    - Firmicutes
    - Bacteroidetes
- Q. How soon after bariatirc surgery is the gut microbes changes ?
    - As soon as three months after the surgery 
- Q. How do certain gut microbes produce weight loss ?
    - Gut microbes --> Short chain fatty acid --> Stimulate [[GLP-1\|GLP-1]] receptors

Summarize the [[Notes in Endocrinology/OBESITY & METABOLIC SYNDROME/Mechanisms of Weight loss after Obesity surgery\|Mechanisms of Weight loss after Obesity surgery]] ?  ^[Akalestou E, Miras AD, Rutter GA, le Roux CW.

        - A) Changes in [[GLP-1\|GLP-1]] and [[PYY\|PYY]]
            - [[RYGB\|RYGB]] the food reaches jejunum and ileum directly - there the L cells are most abandunt and they are stimulated leading to the release of these hormones
