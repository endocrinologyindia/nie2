- Q. What is Telogen?
    - Telogen phase is when there is the resting phase in the hair growth cycle.

- Q. What is Telogen effluvium?
    - It is one of the most common causes of hair loss.
    - It is generally temporary.
    - It is caused by any illness or major physiological stress.
    - Any stress produces the hair to go into a resting phase, and hair growth ceases temporarily to conserve energy.
    - If this is prolonged, then the hair loss soon becomes apparent.
    - Such hair loss is transient and often recovers after the underlying illness is corrected.
    - Hair loss associated with thyroid dysfunction is often due to Telogen effluvium.

- Q. What produces hair loss - hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism?
    - Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause hair loss.

- Q. What is the pattern of hair loss with thyroid disorders?
    - Hair loss is generally diffuse.

- Q. Enlist the patterns of hair loss that may be seen with hypothyroidism?
    - A study done on this topic by Vincent et al. shows that the following are the patterns of hair loss seen in hypothyroid patients ^[Vincent M, Yogiraj K. A descriptive study of alopecia patterns and their relation to thyroid dysfunction. International journal of trichology. 2013 Jan;5(1):57.]:
        - Diffuse alopecia - most common - 70%
        - Alopecia areata - 11%
        - Androgenetic alopecia - 14%
        - Cicatricial alopecia - 0.32%
        - Alopecia totalis - 0.16%
        - Alopecia universalis - 0.41%
        - Madarosis
        - Diminished facial hair - 0.57%
        - Diminished body hair - 0.16%

- Q. Does subclinical hypothyroidism produce hair loss?
    - Subclinical hypothyroidism is unlikely to cause hair loss.
    - This is a common misbelief and often a cause of referral to an endocrinologist.

- Q. Does the hair loss worsen after hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine therapy?
    - Yes.
    - There is a transient worsening of hair loss with hypothyroidism treatment initially.
    - In such cases, paradoxically, the hair loss may follow the treatment for the thyroid, and the thyroid medication may be erroneously blamed, leading to the withdrawal of treatment, which in turn may worsen the hair loss.
    - This occurs because of the correction of hypothyroidism within the first month of therapy.
    - This is because the resting hair follicle becomes active again and is shed rapidly.
    - The new hair that grows, however, is healthy, and in due course, the hair growth improves.

- Q. Does radioactive iodine therapy for Graves' disease produce hair loss?
    - No.
    - RAIT does not cause hair loss.

- Q. Do antithyroid drugs used in Graves' disease produce hair loss?
    - Yes.
    - Carbimazole and PTU cause hair loss on their own.

- Q. What is  alopecia areata  and what is its link with hypothyroidism?
    - Alopecia areata is sudden hair loss that starts with one or more circular bald patches that may overlap.
    - It is more common in children.
    -  Alopecia areata  likely has an autoimmune etiology, and the presence of overt hypothyroidism may have a potential link since it is most often autoimmune.

- Q. Does the treatment of hypothyroidism improve the outcome in  alopecia areata ?
    -  Alopecia areata  often runs an independent course with hypothyroidism.
    - However, there is some improvement seen in clinical practice with levothyroxine treatment.
    - This is most likely due to the correction of ** Telogen effluvium **.

- Q. How do you differentiate hair loss due to alopecia areata versus that of hypothyroidism if they coexist in the same patient?
    - Alopecia produces regional hair loss, unlike that due to thyroid, which is more diffuse hair loss.

- Q. Apart from hair loss from the scalp, is there hair loss from other areas in hypothyroidism?
    - Thyroid dysfunction can also cause eyebrow hair loss, which is often transient and improves with treatment.
    - Body hair may also be lost.
    - "Superciliary madarosis" is a classical sign of hypothyroidism taught to medical students. However, it is rarer than we think.

- Q. What is madarosis?
    - **Madarosis** is defined as the loss or absence of eyelashes (ciliary **madarosis**) or eyebrows (**superciliary madarosis**).

- Q. What are the issues with hair supplements and thyroid?
    - Two issues:
        - Some supplements may contain iodine and may cause thyroid dysfunction (Please see  Iodine deficiency disorders ).
        - Some supplements may have  biotin  which may interfere with thyroid function.

- Q. How common is the use of  biotin  in endocrine tests?
    - At least 50% of the endocrine tests have biotin in their separation step.

- Q. Does  biotin  produce false high or false low?
    - Can cause both depending on the situation:
        - False low:
            - Large molecules with noncompetitive IMA method:
                - C-peptide
                - FSH
                - TSH
                - Prolactin
        - False high:
            - Small molecules with competitive assay:
                - Progesterone
                - Steroid hormones
                - T3, T4

- #Clinicalpearl - Since biotin produces false high for T3 and T4 and false low for TSH, wrong diagnosis of Graves' disease is often seen.

- Q. Where is high dose  biotin  used in
