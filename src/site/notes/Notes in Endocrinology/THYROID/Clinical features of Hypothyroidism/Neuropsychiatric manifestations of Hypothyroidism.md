- Q. Enlist the neurological manifestations of hypothyroidism in adults ?
    - Myxedema coma
    - Cognitive impairment (Dementia)
    - Cerebellar ataxia
    - Peripheral neuropathy – including Carpal tunnel syndrome
    - Hypothyroid myopathy
    - Sensorineural hearing loss


- Q. What are the neurological manifestation of Cretinism (congenital hypothyroidism) ?
    - Intellectual impairment
    - Delayed motor milestones
    - Kocher- Debre- Semelienge syndrome – hypothyroid myopathy
    - Sensio neural hearing loss
    - Strabismus


- Q. What is myxedema madness ?
    - Psychosis seen with severe hypothyroidism


- Q. Cognitive impairment (dementia)  in hypothyroidism is cortical or subcortical ?
    - It is mainly subcortical


- Q. Is  Subclinical hypothyroidism associated with dementia ?
    - Results are conflicting


- Q. What other types of psychiatric manifestations are common in hypothyroidism?
    - Depression and anxiety are common features of hypothyroidism


- Q. Should cognitive impairment in elderly be screened for hypothyroidism?
    - Yes
    - Elderly with cognitive impairment must be screened for hypothyroidism based on AAN guidelines


- Q. Is there a link between Parkinsonism and Hypothyroidism ?
    - Again, conflicting data
    - However patient with Parkinsonism who does not respond to treatment must be screened for hypothyroidism
    - Also Levodopa reduces TSH and hence this care must be taken while screening


- Q. Is hypothyroidism commonly associated with cerebellar ataxia ?
    - Yes


## Hypothyroidism and Depression


Q. What is the relation between  Serotonin levels and  hypothyroidism ?
    - #Clinicalpearl
        -  Serotonin has a feedback loop with TRH. It suppresses TRH 
        - T3 in the brain increases serotonin levels
		
		
- Q. Do larger studies show any relation between depression and hypothyroidism?
    - According to a meta-analysis- some of the larger studies have shown no correlation between depression and hypothyroidism


- Q. What is the biggest bias with these studies ?
    - These studies by its nature, excludes patients already on LT4 and diagnosed to have hypothyroidism previously
    - The remaining people are those who probably did not have an indication for treatment in the first place


- Q. Is there a relationship between any thyroid-related polymorphism and depression?
    - Yes
    - A seminal study on this topic found a strong correlation between polymorphisms in Deiodinase type 2 (DIO2) and depression in hypothyroid Caucasian females 


- Q. Can you elaborate more on this?
    - In the CNS- only type 2 deiodinase is present to convert T4 to T3
    - Subanalysis of various meta-analyses done for T3/T4 combination therapy has shown that a particular subset of patients having a polymorphism rs225014 in DIO2 have benefits in terms of T3 and T4 combination 
    - This polymorphism was present in 12% of subjects
    - There is no biochemical test to identify this subset of a patient and can only be identified with genetic testing 


- Q. Is there any other polymorphism that may have a potential association?
    - Polymorphism in OATP1C1, which helps transport T4 to the brain, may be associated with depressed mood and other psychological features 


- Q. Is there a relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and depression?
    - some studies have shown a correlation between Anti TPO positivity and depression
    - This is especially true since  Post partum thyroiditis is known to present as  depression


- Q. Despite adequate control of  TSH biochemically, do some patients with hypothyroidism continue to have a poor sense of well-being?
    - Yes
    - This has been shown in several studies in patients treated with LT4
    - In fact, some patients on LT4 may have worse psychological outcomes


- Q.  What is  cycle of misattribution?
    - This is one of the reasons why patients with hypothyroidism may not receive clinical response with  Levothyroxine]] treatment
    - Patients having symptoms of depression- tested for hypothyroidism as per protocol - found to have  Subclinical hypothyroidism- treatment started, but to start  Subclinical hypothyroidism was NOT the reason for depression! 
    - This is a cycle of misattribution 


- Q. Does treatment with LT4 improve the mood?
    - There are no convincing placebo-controlled trials to show that there is a clear benefit in the mood with treatment with LT4
    - Only one placebo-controlled trial by Meier et al. have shown some benefit inpatient in whom  TSH was >12 


- Q. Is the combination of T3 and T4 having benefits?
    - This is an area of controversy
    - Large meta-analyses have shown no benefit, while some small studies have shown benefit
    - The exact dose and ratio of T3/T4 is different in different studies and hence making it difficult to interpret


- Q. Is overcorrection associated with adverse psychological outcomes?
    - Largely- trials have not shown this to be true 


- Q. Does adding T3/T4 improve the effectiveness of anti-depressants?
    - Again, this is a controversial area with no clear consensus in either direction
    - Larger trials have shown mixed results- especially with T3
    - At present, there is no benefit of using LT4 or T3 for this purpose 


- Q. What are the take-home messages from hypothyroidism and depression?
    - 1. There is no clear relation between LT4 replacement and improvement in mood with patients with hypothyroidism
    - 2. A lot of these patients may have a cycle of misattribution - a patient with depression having the symptoms attributed to hypothyroidism
    - 3. T3/T4 combination may or may not have the benefit
        - It is beneficial in patients having a functional polymorphism in the DIO2 (type 2 deiodinase) enzyme 
- Evidence-Based Use of Levothyroxine/Liothyronine Combinations in Treating Hypothyroidism: A Consensus Document


- Q. What happens to the T3 when we treat hypothyroidism patients with LT4?
    - Studies in humans have shown that the use of LT4 for treating hypothyroidism leads to normalization of  TSH, but abnormal FT4/FT3 ratio.
    - The FT3 is not normalized like it should be because of LT4


- Q. Where are the  Type 1 deiodinase and  Type 2 deiodinase found in the human body?
    - Type 1 deiodinase- Liver and Kidney
    - Type 2 - is found in the heart, skeletal muscle, CNS, fat, thyroid, and pituitary


- Q. Of the above 2 - which contributes most to the T3 levels?
    - Type 2 deiodinase contributes 80% of the T3 levels 


- Q. So why does treatment with LT4 lead to pooer T4/T3 ratio?
    - LT4 given is taken up by the hypothalamus and pituitary - converted to T3 by the local D2, and then it normalizes  TSH rapidly
    - However, the above correction occurs faster compared to the normalization of T3 levels in the peripheral circulation
    - Hence an adequate T3 level is never achieved before the  TSH is normalized

- Q.  Which specific  Type 2 deiodinase polymorphism has produced this debate?
    - Thy92 Ala


- Q. What effects of the thyroid hormone are thought to occur via a non-canonical or non-thyroid receptor pathway?
    - Effect on cancer growth 


- Q. What are the issues with the clinical trial with T3/T4 combination?
    - The suitable patients may not have been included 
    - The suitable patients include those who are dissatisfied with the T4 replacement 


- Q. What is the pharmacological equivalence between T3 and T4?
    - 1 T3 = 3 T4
    - i.e., 100 mcg of T4 = 33.3 mcg of T3
    - 40 mcg of T3 = 115 mcg of T4 


- Q.  What are the problems with T3 assays?
    - At low concentration, the T3 or FT3 immunoassays are less reliable
    - It is also affected by the patient factors
        - Patients on dietary restriction have lower levels
        - Patients with illness may have lower levels 
        - Age
        - Time of the day 


- Q. If given as monotherapy, how is T3 given?
    - it is given three times a day 
    - Typically, 10 mcg TDS would be around 120 mcg of T4 
    - Trials have used twice a day T3 generally because of patient compliance issue 


- Q. What is the half-life of T3?
    - 22 hours 


- Q. In our terms, how much thyroid hormone is produced by the thyroid gland?
    - 100 mcg of T4 is produced, and the normal thyroid gland produces about five mcg of T3
    - This is about a 14:1 ratio  


- #Clinicalpearl: Slow release T3 preparations are required to solve the problem of the T3 and T4 combination 


- Q. What happens to  TSH with T3 monotherapy is given?
    - Studies have shown that with T3 monotherapy, the  TSH levels tend to be a little lower
    - Fluctuations are also more
    - Lower  TSH]] here may not represent overcorrection


- Q. Which are two critical psychological outcomes attributable to hypothyroidism?
    - Two outcomes attributable to hypothyroidism include
        - Emotional susceptibility
        - Tiredness 
    - Depression and Anxiety are NOT attributable to thyroid dysfunction 


- Q. What is the top psychological concern of patients with hypothyroidism?
    - Fatigue is the chief concern in patients with hypothyroidism
        - General fatigue
        - Physical fatigue
        - Mental fatigue


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Thyroid related QoL indices tend to perform better compared to general QoL indices like SF-36 etc
    - For fatigue specifically, thyroid-related fatigue may be different from other fatigues!


- Q. In hypothyroidism, what is the difference between patient-perceived symptoms and clinician-perceived symptoms ?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FQ1hlKZlyX1.png?alt=media&token=3475c68f-db3a-438a-8188-13447a5e3b15)


- [Why are our hypothyroid patients unhappy? Is tissue hypothyroidism the answer?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169863/?report=printable) 
    -  Zulewski symptom score for hypothyroidism
        - ![An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.
Object name is IJEM-15-95-g001.jpg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169863/bin/IJEM-15-95-g001.jpg)
        - Score ≥ strong correlation with hypothyroidism
        - <2 - less relation 
		
		
- Q. Which two tests should be done to assess tissue level hypothyroidism and its correlation with hypothyroidism?
    - lipid profile]]
    - Creatine kinase]]
    - They have correlation with symptoms
