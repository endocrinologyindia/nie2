<br> - Q. What is [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]? <br>
    - It is a form of Non-infective encephalopathy associated with Autoimmune thyroid disorder with positive [[Anti TPO antibody\|Anti TPO antibody]]
    - It has excellent response to glucocorticoids
    - It is a diagnosis of exclusion 

<br> - Q. Is the term "encephalopathy" same as "encephalitis"? <br>
    - "Encephalopathy" means "brain disorder" and it is a broad term
    - "Encephalitis" means "brain inflammation" and it deals with inflammatory disorder of the brain and it is a more specific term 

<br> - Q. Who was the first to describe [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]? <br>
    - Dr Russell Brain

<br> - Q. What is the timing in terms of presentation? <br>
    - It is subacute in terms of onset 

<br> - Q. What is the most typical clinical presentation of HE? <br> 
    - Subacute confusion with
        - Seizures
        - Myoclonus 
        - Pyschosis
    - With altered consciousness 

<br> - Q. What is the epidemiology of this condition? <br>
    - Age of onset is on an average 51 years
        - However, it has been reported via a wide age variation
    - It is more common in females 

<br> - Q. What are the possible etiologies of Hashimotoâ€™s encephalopathy? <br> 
    - Autoimmune encephalomyelitis
        - Some people think [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]] is a subset or type of ADEM- Acute disseminated encephalomyelities  
    - Autoimmune cerebral vasculitis 
        - Some people think [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]] is a subform of NAIM- which is [[Non-vasculitic inflammatory meningoencephalitis\|Non-vasculitic inflammatory meningoencephalitis]]

<br> - Q. Is it because of the thyroid dysfunction? <br>
    - The neurological features of this condition are INDEPENDENT of the thyroid disorder 
    - The symptoms are NOT due to the thyroid hormone itself and are a result of an associated autoimmune phenomenon 
<br> - Q. What is the typical clinical presentation of this syndrome? <br>
    - It presents as acute or subacute confusion with altered levels of consciousness 
<br> - Q. How does it progress? <br>
    - It progresses in two ways
        - a) It may progress as stroke-like multiple episodes of recurrent focal neurological deficits with variable degree of cognitive dysfunction 
        - b) It may have a diffuse slow progression with deteriorating cognitive function characterized by dementia, hallucination, somnolence etc
<br> - Q. Can seizures be seen in this condition? <br>
    - Yes
    - 2/3rd of patients have seizures are the time of initial presentation
    - it can be both focal as well as generalized seizures 
<br> - Q. What are other neurological features? <br>
    - 1. Psychosis and hallucinations
    - 2. Hyperreflexia and pyramidal tract signs
    - 3. Myoclonus, tremors etc 
<br> - Q. Can pyschiatric symptoms be seen in this condition? <br>
    - Yes
    - In fact, 30% of patients have some form of psychosis or psychiatric symptoms 
<br> - Q. Which antibody is specific against leading to [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]] (HE)? <br>
    - Anti NAE antibody (N-amino terminal of alpha enolase) 
<br> - Q. Can it be associated with hypothyrodism? <br> 
    - Yes 
<br> - Q. Is hypothyroidism always present with [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]? <br>
    - No
    - Thyroid dysfunction runs an independent course
    - [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]] may be associated with 
        - Hypothyroidism
        - Euthyroidism
        - Hyperthyroidism
        - Subclinical thyroid disorders 
<br> - Q. Can [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]] be associates with [[Graves' disease\|Graves' disease]]? <br>
    - Yes
    - But it is very rare 
    - <20 cases have been reported in literature 
<br> - Q. Which is key differentiating feature of HE vs neuropsychiatric manifestation due to hypothyroidism? <br> 
    - Symptoms of hypothyroidism improve with treatment with LT4 whereas HE they do not improve with LT4 treatment 
<br> - Q. Is Anti TPO positive in HE? <br> 
    - It is found in 100% of cases 
    - Anti TPO antibody is also found in CSF and CSF anti TPO antibody may be more sensitive and specific for [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]
<br> - Q. What level of Anti-TPO is associated with [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]? <br>
    - As such there is no correlation between Anti TPO antibody levels and [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]
    - However median values reported in literature are 900 IU/ml
<br> - Q. Which test is useful for follow-up of therapy? <br> 
    - IgG4 level in CSF is useful for follow up of patients with HE 
<br> - Q. What are other common CSF findings? <br>
    - Elevated protein concentration has been reported in the CSF
<br> - Q. What are neuroimaging changes seen with [[Notes in Endocrinology/THYROID/Clinical features of Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's encephalopathy\|Hashimoto's encephalopathy]]? <br>
    - In many cases MRI may be normal
    - However it may be associated with nonspecific focal or diffuse hyperintensities  of the subcortical white matter or ischemic lesion
    - These often improve with glucocorticoid therapy 
<br> - Q. How common are EEG changes seen in such patients? <br>
    - EEG changes are seen in 90% of the patients but they are generally non-specific 
    - Mainly persistent or episodic slow wave changes are seen 
<br> - Q. What is the anti-NMDAR encephalitis and why is it an important differential diagnosis of this case? <br>
    - Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a form of autoimmune encephalitis which it s a paraneoplastic syndrome and it is similar in clinical presentation of this condition
    - It must be ruled out in such patients 
<br> - Q. What is the drug of choice for HE ? <br> 
    - Corticosteroids 
<br> - Q. Do the level of the [[Anti TPO antibody\|Anti TPO antibody]] change with treatment? <br>
    - No 
<br> - Q. What is the new name for HE? <br> 
    - SEAT
    - Steroid responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis  
<br> - Q. Does giving Anti-psychotic medications to such patients presenting with psychosis help? <br>
    - No
    - Antipsychotic medications may paradoxically worsen psychosis/psychiatricsymptoms in some cases (Tseng, 2011). 
    - Hence to be used cautiously.
