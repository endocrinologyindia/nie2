- Q. What are the exact anatomical effects of maternal Hypothyroidism on the fetal brain?
    - Reduced neuronal differentiation
    - Reduced synapse formation
    - Reduced myelin formation
    - Reduced axonal and dendritic growth
    - Reduced astrocyte development


- Q. Which is more critical for fetal development- T4 or TSH?
    - Free T4 and T3 are essential for fetal development
    - TSH is essential for maternal well being


- Q. Does high T4 affect the fetal brain?
    - Both high and low T4 has an adverse effect on fetal brain development


- Q. What is a complete form of the CATS study?
    - Controlled antenatal thyroid screening


- Q. What was the design for the CATS study?
    - Women <15 weeks of gestation  TFT was done
    - Women with Free t4 <2.5 th percentile and TSH >97.5 percentile were treated with 150 mcg of LT4
    - IQ of the child was studied at 3 years
    - In the control group- TFT sample was taken and stored and analyzed after delivery


- Q. What were the results of the CATS study?
    - Antenatal screening (at a median gestational age of 12 weeks 3 days) and maternal treatment for Hypothyroidism did not improve cognitive function in children at 3 years of age.


- Q. Summarize the intrauterine timings in relation to the thyroid and neurological development?
    - Neurological development – starts at 5 weeks
    - Thyroid receptor present by 8 weeks
    - Thyroid gland development – 12 weeks
    - Thyroid hormone production – 16-18 weeks of gestation
    - Hence from 5 weeks to 18 weeks – the fetus is dependent on the maternal thyroid

- Q. What are the neurological manifestation of fetal Hypothyroidism?
    - Mental retardation and low IQ
    - Developmental delay
    - Spasticity
    - Deafness


- Q. How is the fetus protected from an excessive amount of maternal T4?
    - By type 3 deiodinase present in the placenta


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Thyroid is essential for brain development in the first 1000 days of life, including the antenatal period


- Q. Which affects the fetal brain- T4 or T3?
    - T3
    - Fetal neurological tissue has local deiodinase 2, which converts T4 to T3


- Q. Which are the various thyroid hormone transporters in the fetus?
    - MCT8 and 10
    - OATP2 and OATp3
    - LAT1 and LAT2


- Q. Describe with diagram the transport process of thyroid hormone in the fetus?

- Q. What is the importance of MCT8?
    - MCT8 is critical for T3 to enter the neurons
    - Hence MCT8 deficiency produces a neurological disorder called Allan-Herndon Dudley syndrome


- Q. What neurological outcomes are studied in various studies in relation to fetal brain and thyroid?
    - IQ
    - Risk of ADHD
    - Risk of Autism
    - Risk of schizophrenia
    - Gray matter volume and morphology


- Q. What is the Generation R study?
    - Study published in Lancet
    - Showed that both high and low T4 is associated with lower IQ in children
    - This was the population-based prospective cohort study


- Q. How much is IQ reduction seen in infants of mothers having untreated Hypothyroidism?
    - 7 point reduction in IQ
    - This is from a study by Haddow et al


- Q. Is lower maternal T4 associated with poor brain outcomes?
    - Prolonged low T4 is in mother is associated with poor neurological outcomes


- **Iodine nutrition and pregnancy **


- Q. What is the recommended intake of iodine during pregnancy?
    - 250 mcg/day


- Q. How is iodine deficiency assessed?
    - Using urinary iodine concentration
    - Sufficient iodine status is determined by UIC of 150-250 mcg/l


- Q. How much gap must be there between thyroid supplementation and iron supplementation?
    - At least 4 hours


- Q. What should be the iodine intake during breastfeeding?
    - 250 mcg/day (some recommend 290 mcg/day)


- Q. Why is iodine deficiency during pregnancy so important?
    - Because it is the leading cause of preventable brain damage


- Q. When does iodine deficiency produce neurological cretinism, and when does it produce myxomatous cretinism in infants?
    - Iodine deficiency in early pregnancy – neurological cretinism
    - Iodine deficiency later in pregnancy – myxomatous cretinism
