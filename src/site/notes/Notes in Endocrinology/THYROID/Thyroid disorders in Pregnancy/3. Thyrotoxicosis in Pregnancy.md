- Q. What are the potential complications of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy?
    - Abortion
    - Low birth weight
    - Premature labor
    - Stillbirth
    - Pre-eclampsia
    - Heart failure


- Q. Which are the two most common causes of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy?
    - Graves’ disease
    - HCG mediated hyperthyroidism 
        - Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis
        - Hyperemesis gravidarum
        - Trophoblastic hyperthyroidism
        - Familial gestational hyperthyroidism


- Q. What test is done to differentiate the above two diagnoses?
    - TSH receptor antibody using 3rd generation TBII assay


- Q. Using T3, T4, how will you distinguish the two?
    - Graves disease has more T3 elevation
    - HCG mediated have both T3 and T4 elevation but more of T4


- Q. At what time does HCG peak, and by what time does it fall?
    - Peaks at 10-12 weeks
    - Falls by 14-18 weeks


- Q. Which patients with hyperthyroidism in pregnancy are treated?
    - Patients having overt moderate to severe hyperthyroidism due to Graves’ disease, gestational trophoblastic disease, and  other causes are treated
    - Patients with mild hyperthyroidism with T3/T4 < 1.5 times the ULN of the non-pregnant range are not treated


- Q. Which is the only form of HCG-mediated hyperthyroidism that is treated?
    - One secondary to gestational trophoblastic disease with overt hyperthyroidism and moderate to severe symptoms


- Q. What is the goal of the treatment of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (what are the TFT targets) ?
    - T4 in upper limit or just above the trimester-specific normal range
    - If a trimester-specific range is not available, keep free T4 in the upper limit of the normal range of non-pregnant women using the lowest possible dose
    - TSH- lower limit or normal or suppressed


- Q. What is the role of beta-blockers in the management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy?
    - IT IS GENERALLY AVOIDED
    - Beta-blockers in low doses may be given in the initial part of the management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, mainly for symptomatic control (In special circumstances ONLY)
    - They should be weaned off once ATD effects have taken over
    - Typically, atenolol in a dose of 25-50 mg or Propranolol 20 mg TID may be given in the initial phase
    - Generally not given for more than 2-6 weeks


- Q. What are the potential adverse effect of beta-blocker on the fetus ?
    - Bradycardia
    - Hypoglycemia
    - Low birth weight
    - Respiratory depression


- Q. Which of the two – PTU or Methimazole (MMI)/Carbimazole crosses the placenta?
    - Both cross the placenta 
    - However, teratogenicity is more observed with Methimazole/Carbimazole and not PTU


- Q. Which is the most common teratogenicity with MMI?
    - Aplasia cutis


- Q. Which are other potential manifestations?
    - Choanal atresia
    - Tracheoesophageal fistula
    - Patent vitellointestinal duct
    - Omphalocele
    - Omphalomesntric duct


- Q. What is the difference in potential liver toxicity of PTU vs. MMI ?
    - PTU- produces hepatocellular inflammation- hepatitis while MMI produces cholestasis


- Q. Which ATD are used when during pregnancy ?
    - If women already on treatment with MMI becomes pregnant – switch to PTU as soon as pregnancy is confirmed
    - In second trimester switch to MMI or Carbimazole again
    - PTU 300 mg = 10-15 mg of MMI


- Q. Should LFT be monitored while on PTU therapy  ?
    - No
    - Because the hepatotoxicity is idiosyncratic and hence no point of LFT monitoring
    - If however monitoring is done, PTU is stopped if Liver enzymes are >3 times ULN
    - Stop PTU and monitor LFT, if it is rising – refer to hepatologist


- Q. What is done in the third trimester ?
    - Autoimmune thyroid disease often improves in 3rd trimester
    - If a patient goes into remission in 3rd trimester than ATD can be potentially tapered and stopped if TFT is normal and TRAb is negative
    - Some women switch from TSH stimulating to blocking antibody
    - Stopping of drug is possible in 1/3rd of women


- Q. What is the starting dose of PTU / MMI in pregnancy ?
    - Start with lowest possible dose
        - PTU- 50 mg TID
        - MMI- 5-10 mg
        - CBZ- 5-15 mg


- Q. What are the consequence of under-treatment and over treatment of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy on the fetal thyroid function ?
    - Undertreatment – may lead to central hypothyroidism due to negative feedback of excess T4/T3
    - Overtreatment- fetal primary hypothyroidism


- Q. Graves disease improves postpartum, True or false ?
    - False
    - It may worsen postpartum
    - Also women in remission – may relapse in postpartum period


- Q. Which are 2 important consequences of uncontrolled hyperthyroidism in 3rd trimester?
    - Neonatal thyrotoxicosis
    - Low birth weight


- Q. What is the indication for surgery in hyperthyroidism in pregnancy ?
    - When a patient has allergy or agranulocytosis due to ATD
    - In such cases, surgery can be completed in 2nd trimester
    - However, risk of surgical complications are higher


- Q. What preparation is done before surgery ?
    - Beta-blockers and
    - Low dose of SSKI- 1-3 drops/day for 7-10 days before surgery


- **Nursing mothers **


- Q. Which is secreted more in breast milk- PTU or MMI ?
    - MMI is excreted more in breast milk as it is less protein-bound unlike PTU
    - However, since dose of MMI is much lower- risk of fetal complications are less
    - There are very rare/ no cases of fetal complications due to drug presence in breast milk – for either drug
    - Hence MMI is preferred in nursing mothers because of less risk of hepatotoxicity


- Q. Should TFT of infant be monitored if mother is on MMI ?
    - Generally no
    - However, if MMI dose is >20 mg – then monitor TFT of infant every 1-3 months


- **Fetal hyperthyroidism **


- Q. What TRAb level in 2nd and 3rd trimester predict the occurrence of neonatal hyperthyroidism ?
    - 2nd/ 3rd trimester TRAb levels > 3 times ULN or > 5 IU/l predict the occurrence of neonatal hyperthyroidism with 100% sensitivity and 40% specificity.


- Q. When is the TRAb level typically determined during pregnancy ?
    - TRAb level is tested typically at 18-22 weeks of pregnancy


- Q. What is the risk of fetal hyperthyroidism in women with Graves disease in pregnancy ?
    - 1-5% risk


- Q. What are the signs of fetal hyperthyroidism ?
    - Fetal HR >160 bpm
    - Fetal goiter – with central blood flow on Doppler
    - Craniosynostosis
    - Advanced bone age
    - Poor growth
    - Rare cases- heart failure and hydrops


- Q. When is TRAb monitoring done in 3rd trimester and what is its role ?
    - It is done at 24-28 weeks
    - TRAb levels >3-5 times the ULN suggest a high risk of fatal complication


- Q. A woman has past history of Graves disease but currently in remission. Should TRAb be measured in such women?
    - Yes
    - TRAb must be measured at 20-24 weeks and if >3-5 times ULN fetal monitoring is required
    - Women may be in remission but TRAb may persist and hence monitoring is necessary


- Q. What are the types of assays for TRAb  ?
    - TBII assay- just tells about presence of antibodies but does not tell about function – it is less expensive and generally adequate test in pregnancy
    - TSI assay – tells about function of the TRAb- stimulatory or not but more expensive


- Q. How is the monitoring of the fetus done in case of TRAb antibodies being positive ?
    - Fetal heart rate monitoring and regular ultrasound


- Q. What is THE characteristic of goiter in fetal hyperthyroidism ?
    - They have central flow  on color doppler which is not seen in fetal goiter due to hypothyroidism


- Q.. Can fetal thyroid function be measured  ?
    - Yes
    - But umbilical vein sampling at 20 weeks
    - However, this is not routinely recommended


- Q. When is fetal thyroid function done ?
    - It is done if there is fetal goiter and it is not sure whether the fetus has hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism due to maternal ATD treatment


- Q. If the mother is euthyroid, but fetal hyperthyroidism is confirmed- what is done ?
    - Mother is treated with ATD despite being euthyroid


- Q. How can you differentiate fetal hypothyroidism from fetal hyperthyroidism ?
    - Fetal hypothyroidism vs [[Fetal hyperthyroidism\|Fetal hyperthyroidism]]
