-   Q. What is the upper limit of TSH cutoff to define hypothyroidism in pregnancy ?
    -   The earlier guidelines recommended cutoffs of 2.5 , 3.0 and 3.0 in 1st , 2nd and 3rd Trimester.
    -   The new guidelines recommend as follows:
    -   Use the cutoff obtained from normal pregnant women in your centre.
    -   If they are not available, use cutoff which are similar to your population.
    -   If again, they are un-available then use ULN of TSH as 4.0 mIU/l


-   Q. What is the trimester specific reference range of TSH as obtained from study done in Haryana ?
    -   In the study done by Rajput et al, the 2.5–97.5th percentiles for TSH obtained in this study were
    -   1st Trimester- 0.37–3.69 μIU/ml
    -   2nd Trimester- 0.54–4.47 μIU/ml
    -   3rd trimester- 0.70–4.64 μIU/ml


-   Q. What is definition of isolated hypothyroxemia of pregnancy ?
    -   Free T4 in the range of lower < 2.5th – 5th percentile of population with normal TSH


-   Q. What were the free T4 cutoff ranges in study done in Haryana by Rajput et al ?
    -   FT4,
        -   1st T - 0.88–1.78 ng/ml
        -   2nd T- 0.91–1.78 ng/ml
        -   3rd T - 0.83–1.73 ng/ml

- Q. Is hypothyroidism associated with infertility ?
    - Hypothyroidism in certain cases is associated with
        - Anovulation
        - Increase 1st-trimester abortion


- Q. What are the potential complications of hypothyroidism in pregnancy?
    - Abortion
    - Preterm delivery
    - Increase perinatal morbidity and mortality
    - Hypertension in pregnancy
    - Increase LSCS
    - Placental abruption
    - Postpartum hemorrhage
    - Neurocognitive impairment


- Q. What are complications with Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in
pregnancy?
    - Increase the risk of
    - Preterm delivery
    - Fetal loss
    - Placental abruption
    - Pre-eclampsia
    - More with those who are TPO positive
	
	
- Q. Is SCH in pregnancy associated with a higher risk of cognitive
impairment?
    - Observation studies have shown such a result
    - But RCT has not shown any effect on cognitive impairment
	
	
- Q. What is the definition of isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia of
pregnancy?
    - Free T4 in the lower 5th to 10th percentile of
reference range
    - TSH is a normal range
	
	
- Q. Is isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia associated with poor outcomes?
    - Studies have shown mixed results
    - Some studies have shown an increased risk of preterm delivery
    - Effect on IQ also has shown mixed results. However, an RCT has shown no
difference


- **Treatment **


- Q. Is the treatment of isolated hypothyroxinaemia indicated?
    - No

- Q. For hypothyroid women planning to be pregnant, what should be the
advice?
    - Keep TSH <2.5 before pregnancy – some suggest <1.2
    - Increase of dose may be required once pregnancy is confirmed
    - Patient can pre-exmptively increase the dose by 30%
	
	
- Q. What is the simple way of increasing thyroid dose in women with
pre-existing thyroid disease who becomes pregnant?
    - Ask the patient to take the same dose nine times a week instead of 7!
    - Double the dose on two days of the week
	
	
- Q. What is the reason for the increase of thyroid hormone requirement during
pregnancy?
    - Increase of TBG and it's binding
    - Transfer of T4 to the fetus
    - Reduce iodine
    - Increase destruction of T4 by the placenta
    - Reduce absorption due to iron and calcium
	
	
- Q. What is the dose of levothyroxine in pregnancy?
    - Moderate to severe hypothyroidism- full replacement dose of 1.6 mcg/kg
    - TSH <10 – give 1 mcg/kg


- **Pregnancy outcome in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and pregnancy **


- Q. Give the data for pregnancy outcome and SCH, which show more fetal
loss?
    - 1. Chinese study
        - Women with TSH 5-10 had more fetal loss compared to women with normal
thyroid function (7 % vs 2%)
        - Those with SCH and Anti TPO positive- had the highest risk – 15%
    - 2. Negro et al
        - In Anti TPO negative women :
        - TSH 2.5- 5.0 had higher fetal loss compared to those with TSH <2.5 in
1st trimester (6% vs. 3%)
    - 3. Baker et al
        - Patients undergoing IVF – those with TSH <2.5 had better outcomes
than those with TSH >2.5


- Q. Overall, Does treatment for [[Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy\|Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy]] have any benefit?
    - The main results come from a trial in Iran which had shown that the risk of Preterm delivery is reduced if SCH is treated
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2Fd4qOOmUck-.jpg?alt=media&token=859aa70e-24ee-4882-b01c-c05d5663a4cb)
    - The [[Casey trial\|Casey trial]] published in NEJM did not show any benefit in any parameter - this was a negative trial
        - however, this trial started intervention at 17 weeks which was a little too late, right?
  
- Q. What do the current guidelines say about treating [[Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy\|Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy]]
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2Fx01giPjB_9.jpg?alt=media&token=3b9b1c9f-b63e-4cfd-9c54-3a08e33d7317)
    - TSH >10-  treatment is a must 
    - TSH 4-10 with TPO positive - treatment MUST be given - moderate evidence to support this 
    - TSH 2.5-4 with TPO positive- weak evidence - it is the gray area
    - TSH 4 to 10 with TPO negative - and again gray area
    - Isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia- current guidelines do not recommend treatment

- Q. What is the data about women with SCH with negative TPO antibodies?
    - The data comes from a trial by Nazarpour et al. published in JCEM
    - This is a trial done in SCH women with NEGATIVE TPO antibody 
    - So results of this trial were
        - TPO negative women with TSH 2.5-4.0- no difference in preterm delivery on treatment
        - those with TSH >4.0 had a significant benefit in terms of lesser preterm delivery on treatment 
        - the dose of LT4 given was 1 mcg/kg per day
    - Notes from the study 
        - this is a well-conducted study and very well written
        - so, in this study, they took three groups-
            - A- treated with LT4
            - B- not treated
            - C- Control group
        - Now, in this, they clearly showed that in TPO negative women 
            - If TSH >4 with anti-TPO negative- there is a clear benefit of treatment in terms of preterm delivery
            - if TSH is 2.5-4.0, there is no benefit 
            - the graph below clearly summarizes the outcome
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F6GAYPNAOgl.jpg?alt=media&token=0de7115a-ba4b-4415-9b74-39d2626c683a)
        - Conclusion from the author
            - So, this study targets an important subpopulation 
            - i.e., TPO negative women
            - ^^In women with TSH 4 to 10 and TPO negative treatment with LT4 in the dose of 1 ug/kg shows clear benefit ^^


- Q. Tell me more about [[Anti TPO antibody\|Anti TPO antibody]] and pregnancy
    - Studies have consistently shown a correlation between [[Anti TPO antibody\|Anti TPO antibody]] and preterm delivery
    - if the TSH is higher, the problem is worse
    - We don't know if treatment is going to benefit in any way
        - The study by [[Negro\|Negro]] did show benefit with treatment - this study was published in 2006
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FKfklTverwU.jpg?alt=media&token=cfb10a93-b4ad-4317-8486-1861e1a838ff)
    - However, the recent [[TABLET trial\|TABLET trial]] published in the NEJM did not show any benefit 
    - the current guidelines suggest that Euthyroid anti-TPO positive women  no treatment should be given
    - However, if they have a prior history of misconception- then treatment may be considered 


- Q. Why does [[Anti TPO antibody\|Anti TPO antibody]] cause fetal loss ? #ClinicalPearl
    - There are two ways
        - TSH dependent way
            - Changes in endometrial T cells
            - Less IL4 and IL10 secretion and increased interferon-gamma secretion 
            - increase cytotoxic T cell migration
            - increase the immunogenicity of the uterus 
        - TSH independent way 
            - Reduced response of thyroid gland to HCG stimulation
            - development of subclinical or overt hypothyroidism 


- Q. Tell me more about the [[TABLET trial\|TABLET trial]] ?
    - [Levothyroxine in Women with Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies before Conception | NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812537)
        - This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether levothyroxine treatment would increase live-birth rates among euthyroid women who had thyroid peroxidase antibodies and a history of miscarriage or infertility. 
        - A total of 19,585 women from 49 hospitals in the United Kingdom underwent testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid function. 
        - They randomly assigned 952 women to receive either 50 μg once daily of levothyroxine (476 women) or placebo (476 women) before conception through the end of pregnancy. 
        - The primary outcome was live birth after at least 34 weeks of gestation.
        - ^^There were no significant between-group differences in other pregnancy outcomes^^, including pregnancy loss or preterm birth, or in neonatal outcomes. Serious adverse events occurred in 5.9% of women in the levothyroxine group and 3.8% in the placebo group (P=0.14).
        - > The use of levothyroxine in euthyroid women with thyroid peroxidase antibodies did not result in a higher rate of live births than placebo 


- Q. Is there a study by Nazarpour et al for [[Anti TPO antibody\|Anti TPO antibody]] positive women ?
    - Yes
    - Other studies by [[Nazarpour\|Nazarpour]]
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FXNwjAcoc1_.png?alt=media&token=59156bcc-e418-4c71-8d71-95527c46f408)
    - In this study, they studied the impact of LT4 in preventing preterm delivery in [[TPO\|TPO]] positive women
        - again, they found there was a benefit- but it was mainly confined to women with TSH >4.0 
        - No benefit in euthyroid women with TPO positive (i.e., TSH <2.5)
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FSUn3u7l9dT.png?alt=media&token=2236977c-f0af-4b3e-a852-046016932165)
        - The dose used in the above study was as follows:
            - dose of 0.5 µg/kg/day if they had TSH<1.0 µIU/mL
            - 0.75 µg/kg/day for TSH between 1.0 and 2.0 µIU/mL
            - 1 µg/kg/day dose for TSH >2.0 µIU/mL or a TPOAb titer exceeding 1500 IU/mL; dosages were maintained throughout gestation
        - One of the important things they have suggested, which has practical importance, is that the benefit is the most of the medication is started between 8 weeks when more of the abortions happen #ClinicalPearl


- Q. So what is the story so far from the above trials about Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy?
    - So the story so far for [[Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy\|Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy]] 
        - SCH is definitely associated with poor obstetric outcome
        - The outcome is worse in those with TPO positive
        - both low Free T4 and high Free T4 are associated with low  IQ in children
        - But the question is - "Does treatment with LT4 offer benefit ?"
            - The study done by Nazapour from Iran shows that women who are TPO negative and TSH is more than 4 have benefited from LT4 treatment in a dose of 1 ug/kg. But no benefit is seen if TSH is 2.5-4.0
            - Another study by the same author in another journal shows TPO-positive women have benefits- especially those with TSH >4.0. The benefit in TSH 2.5-4.0 is minimal 
                - The dose used in the above study was as follows:
                    - dose of 0.5 µg/kg/day if they had TSH<1.0 µIU/mL
                    - 0.75 µg/kg/day for TSH between 1.0 and 2.0 µIU/mL
                    - 1 µg/kg/day dose for TSH >2.0 µIU/mL or a TPOAb titer exceeding 1500 IU/mL; dosages were maintained throughout gestation


-   Q. How is adjustment done postpartum ?
		-   Postpartum reduce the dose to what patient was taking preconception.
		-   Or in other words, reduce the dose by 25-30% and repeat the thyroid function at 6 week post partum.
		-   Some patient who are treated during pregnancy may not require treatment post partum and LT4 may be discontinued in such patients. A repeat TFT at 6 weeks must be done.

-   Q. Does uncontrolled maternal hypothyroidism impact lactation ?
		-   Yes. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism is associated with poor lactation.
		-   Additionally in women with poor lactation, additionally, hypothyroidism must be ruled out.

        - Any value of TSH above 10 must be considered [[Overt hypothyroidism\|Overt hypothyroidism]]
        - Prefer [[Free T4\|Free T4]] to [[Total T4\|Total T4]] for assessment
            - Back to subhypo, why care?
            - Because it is the opposite of normal physiology (fig):
            - hCG➡️TSH receptor stimulation➡️FT4⬆️& TSH⬇️
            - Also, hCG➡️pituitary TSH receptor stimulation➡️ultrashort feedback loop➡️TSH suppression
            - AKA the Brokken-Wiersinga-Prummel Loop https://t.co/wtLxrCHSNh https://t.co/mJjUyszL9u
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F8BTv0WA9XB.jpg?alt=media&token=4b67cdb0-578a-4ecd-8784-b2d55cfa92ad)
            - Remember the TSH is lower due to HCG than it would be in a non-pregnant person 
        - Nice graphic from the [[ATA guidelines\|ATA guidelines]]
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FLE7i6j75m6.jpg?alt=media&token=77af6c16-afd8-4996-a92b-33c239b2fc38)
        - [[TPO\|TPO]] positive women have a poor response of the thyroid gland to the [[HCG\|HCG]] #important
        - Hence classification based on the TPO makes sense 
        - TPO positive women have more risk of abortion
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FvQUNT0yUPX.jpg?alt=media&token=fdea2f21-fd53-4a8a-a32b-7d2962b675b2)
        - So the risk is fine but does that translate the risk of benefit
        - One RCT has shown that giving LT4 reduces the risk of preterm delivery
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FdAD04Be4rc.jpg?alt=media&token=671712f9-1f84-455f-aa0b-0ed172b7416a)

        - "If you decide to treat, don't overtreat."
        - Summary and take-homes
            - Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy:
            - Reflects an abnormal physiology
            - Use correct reference ranges to diagnose
            - Risk stratify TPOAbs, gestational age, etc.
            - If you treat, ➡️ Don’t overtreat
        - My notes
            - Anti TPO plays an important role in risk stratification because anti-TPO positive women don't respond to HCG
            - Free T4 is more important for diagnosis and treatment
            - In the gray area - look at situations where you wish to treat vs. not treat
            - Don't over-treat it  - that is a problem
            - Only one RCT shows the benefit of LT4 in SCH in pregnancy in reducing preterm delivery
            - The risk of SCH + Anti TPO and probability of miscarriage is very high 


#Updates 

- Additional Notes from the American Thyroid association 2017 guidelines

-   Q. What are the risk of overt hypothyroidism in pregnancy ?
    -   Low IQ of child
    -   Spontaneous pregnancy loss
    -   Low birth weight
    -   Premature birth


-   Q. How much IQ is reduced in overt hypothyroid women who are not treated ?
    -   7 point reduction in IQ of the child in over hypothyroid women who are not treated.


-   Q. Is subclinical hypothyroidism with Anti TPO negative associated with increase pregnancy loss ?
    -   Yes
    -   There is some evidence to suggest this.
    -   Pearl
    -   Euthyroid women with anti TPO positive- increase risk of spontenous pregnancy loss
    -   Subclinical hypothyrodism with anti TPO negative- also increased risk of spontenous pregnancy loss.


-   Q. Is Subclinical hypothyroidism associated with increase risk of preterm delivery ?
    -   Subclinical hypothyroidism with anti TPO positive- increased risk of preterm delivery
    -   SCH without Anti TPO antibody – may have risk if TSH 5-10 but no risk if TSH 2.5-5.0


-   Q. Does treating subclinical hypothyroidism in mother improve the IQ in the offspring ?
    -   CATS study and other recent study donot show improvement in outcome in IQ in child of women with subclinical hypothyroidism or isolated hypothyroxemia who are treated with LT4.
    -   However, lack of positive outcome does not rule possibility of harmful effects in the offspring.


-   Q. Is isolated hypothyroxemia associated with lower IQ in children ?
    -   There is insuffienct evidence for or against this.
    -   However, there is no evidence that treating isolated hypothyroxemia


-   Q. Is treatment of overt hypothyroidism recommended in pregnancy ?
    -   Yes


-   Q. What should be the treatment TSH target for treatment while treating hypothyroidism in pregnancy ?
    -   The TSH target should be in the lower half of pregnancy specific range.
    -   If local pregnancy specific range is not available then it is recommend to keep TSH <2.5 mIU/l


-   Q. How frequently is monitoring of thyroid function done in women with hypothyroidism in pregnancy ?
    -   Monitoring of thyroid function should be done every 4 weeks till midgestation and then once near 30 weeks


-   Q. How is dose changed in women with preconception hypothyroidism on LT4 replacement ?
    -   One simple way is to ask patient to take 2 additional tablet in the week, for example instead of 7 tablets of LT4 take 9 tablets
    -   Or in other words increase the dose by 25-30% from the preconception dose as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.


-   Q. In hypothyroid women planning to get pregnant what should be the preconception TSH ?
    -   Preconception TSH should be kept <2.5
