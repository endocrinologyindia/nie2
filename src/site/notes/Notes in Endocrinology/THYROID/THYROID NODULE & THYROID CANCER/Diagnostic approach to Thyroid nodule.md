- Q. What is the definition of a thyroid nodule? 
    - A thyroid nodule is a discrete lesion in the thyroid gland which is radiologically distinct from surrounding tissues 


- Q. Broadly, Thyroid nodules of which size are evaluated? 
    - All thyroid nodules>1 cm – evaluate
    - Selected thyroid nodules <1 cm – evaluate 


- Q. Should family members of patients with thyroid cancer (non-medullary) be screened for thyroid nodules? 
    - No recommendation by ATA 2015
    - 5-10% of cases of DTC are familial
    - Ultrasound screening may lead to early diagnosis. However, is no evidence that it will improve morbidity or mortality 


- Q. Thyroid nodules are more common in men or women? 
    - More in women 


- Q. How common is malignancy in thyroid nodules? 
    - 5% of thyroid nodules are malignant 


- Q. How common are thyroid nodules in India? 
    - 9.6% by ultrasound
    - 1.6% by palpation


- Q. Prevalence of malignancy in thyroid nodule is higher in which group of patients? 
    - Children
    - Men
    - Age >60 years or <30 years
    - History of head and neck irradiation
    - Family history of thyroid cancer 


- Q. Multinodular goiters have a higher risk of thyroid malignancy, True or false? 
    - False
    - They have a lower risk of thyroid malignancy 


- **History and physical examination**


- Q. Are history and physical examination accurate for evaluation of thyroid nodule? 
    - No
    - It carries low sensitivity and specificity for predicting malignancy in a thyroid nodule 


- Q. Which points in history suggest cancer in thyroid nodule? 
    - Rapid growth of the nodule
    - History of head and neck irradiation in childhood
    - History of total body irradiation for bone marrow transplant
    - Family history of thyroid cancer- Cowden’s syndrome, MEN 2, FAP


- Q. Which findings in physical examination give a possibility of thyroid cancer? 
    - Hard fixed mass on palpation
    - Vocal chord paralysis
    - Cervical lymphadenopathy
    - Obstructive symptoms 


- **Algorithm for evaluation of thyroid nodule**


- Q. Which have a higher risk of malignancy- Non-palpable nodule or palpable nodule? 
    - Both have an equal risk of malignancy 


- Q. Which is the most accurate way for assessment of thyroid nodule? 
    - FNAC


- Q. Give the step-wise algorithm for evaluation of thyroid nodule? 
    - Step 1 
        - Thyroid function test
        - TSH- Normal / High → Go for Ultrasound
        - TSH- low → thyroid scintigraphy

    - Step 2- TSH is normal or high or if you find a Cold nodule on scintigraphy- Use USG of thyroid for Risk categorization 
        - High risk of malignancy- More 70% risk
            - Hypoechoic plus
            - Microcalcification
            - Incomplete halo
            - Invading adjacent lymph node
            - Extrathyroid extension
            - Irregular margin
            - Taller than wider 
        - Intermediate risk - 10-20% risk
            - Hypoechoic with regular margin 
        - Low-risk risk 5-10%
            - Hyperechoic with irregular margin
            - isoechoic with a regular margin 
            - Partially cystic with an eccentric solid area  
        - Very low risk - <3%
            - Spongiform
            - Partially cystic with no suspicious features
        - Likely Benign <1%
            - Purely cystic 
    - Step 3a- FNAC Indications: 
        - High risk and intermediate-risk- Nodule >1 cm
        - Low risk- >1.5 cm
        - Very low risk - >2 cm 
        - Purely cystic- no need for FNAC 
    - Step 3b  - Follow-up
        - If FNAC is not indicated- follow up with ultrasound
        - High suspicion- repeat USG in 6-12 months
        - Intermediate / low risk- rpt USG in 12- 24 months
        - Very low suspicion >1 cm- repeat USG after 24 months
        - Very low suspicion <1 cm – no need for repeat USG 
    - Step 4- FNAC risk categorization- Bethesda method
        - Non-diagnostic
        - Benign
        - FLUS- follicular lesions of unknown significance
        - Follicular adenoma/carcinoma
        - Suspicious of malignancy
        - Confirmed malignancy 
    - Step 5- Management based on Bethesda
        - Bethesda 1- Non-diagnostic- Repeat FNAC 
            - If still, non-diagnostic consider lobectomy if high suspicious features present
            - Else follow up 
        - Bethesda 2- Benign- Follow up with ultrasound
            - High suspicion US pattern- repeat USG guide FNAC within 12 months
            - Intermediate / low suspicion – repeat USG after 12-24 months. Repeat FNAC if :
                - more 20% increase in size in 2 or more dimension
                - more 50% increase in volume
                - New suspicious features on ultrasound
            - Very low suspicion on the US- no need to repeat FNAC – if required repeat after 24 months
            - Two or more FNAC – suggestive of benign- no more follow up required 
        - Bethesda 3 and 4- FLUS/ AUS, Follicular adenoma
            - Molecular marker 
            - Or Diagnostic lobectomy 
    - Bethesda 5 – Suspicious of malignancy
        - Total thyroidectomy vs. diagnostic lobectomy vs. molecular marker 
    - Bethesda 6- confirmed malignancy
        - Thyroidectomy - Surgery 


- Q. What are the new ATA 2015 guidelines for follow-up of a lesion designated as benign on FNAC? 
    - 1. High suspicion US pattern- repeat USG guide FNAC within 12 months
    - 2. Intermediate/low suspicion – repeat USG after 12-24 months. Repeat FNAC if :
        - More 20% increase in size in 2 or more dimension
        - More 50% increase in volume
        - New suspicious features on ultrasound
    - 3. Very low suspicion on the US- no need to repeat FNAC – if required repeat after 24 months
    - 4. Two or more FNAC – suggestive of benign- no more follow up required 


- Q. What are ACUS and FLUS? 
    - ACUS- Atypical cells of undetermined  significance 
    - FLUS- Follicular lesion of undetermined significance 


- Q. Where does molecular testing for thyroid nodule fall under the algorithm of a thyroid nodule? 
    - They are used in patients with ACUS or FLUS  


- **Lab investigations**


- Q. Does the TSH level have any correlation with the risk of thyroid cancer? 
    - Higher the TSH – higher the risk of thyroid cancer 
    - “Serum TSH is an independent risk factor for predicting malignancy in a thyroid nodule. In a study of 1500 patients presenting to a thyroid practice, the prevalence of malignancy was 2.8, 3.7, 8.3, 12.3, and 29.7 percent for patients with serum TSH concentrations <0.4 mU/L, 0.4 to 0.9 mU/L, 1.0 to 1.7 mU/L, 1.8 to 5.5 mU/L, and >5.5 mU/L, respectively.  Other studies had shown that when cancer was diagnosed, a higher TSH was associated with a more advanced stage of cancer.” 


- **THYROID SCINTIGRAPHY**


- Q. What are the roles of thyroid scintigraphy in the evaluation of thyroid nodules? 
    - It is done in case of low TSH
    - To select the thyroid nodule for FNAC in case of multinodular goiter- cold nodules being preferred 


- Q. What can be the difference between pertechnetate scan and iodine scan in thyroid nodules? 
    - Most thyroid nodules show congruence in pertechnetate and iodine scan
    - However, 5% of malignant nodules appear hot in pertechnetate scan but cold in iodine scan
    - Hence hot nodules in pertechnate must be confirmed by radioiodine scan 
    - These are called DISCORDANT NODULES 


- Q. Does an autonomous nodule (on radioiodine) require FNAC ? 
    - No
    - They are rarely malignant 


- Q. What are warm nodules (indeterminate nodules)? 
    - Nodules that have uptake same as surrounding tissue- i.e., neither cold nor hot 
    - They must be distinguished from hot nodules by the T4 suppression test


- Q. What is the T3/T4 suppression test? 
    - Perform the Radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU)
    - GIVE T3 25 UG TID FOR 10 DAYS OR T4 125 UG OD FOR 14 DAYS
    - REPEAT RAIU AFTER GIVING THIS
        - If Autonomous functioning – Hot nodule will remain hot- background  uptake is suppressed
        - If Warm nodule- reduced uptake in the nodule in repeat scan- this suggests warm nodule- Warm nodule may be malignant


- Q. Should calcitonin be measured routinely in all patients with MTC? 
    - It is controversial
    - Lots of false positive
    - ATA is not for or against it 


- Q. What type of stimulation test can be performed to differentiate MTC from C cell hyperplasia inpatient with raised basal calcitonin? 
    - Pentgastrin stimulation test 
    - Some people even advise calcium stimulation test
    - Must be done if basal calcitonin is >10 pg/ml 


- Q. What are the causes of false-positive raised calcitonin? 
    - Hypercalcemia
    - Hypergastrinemia
    - Neuroendocrine tumors
    - Renal failure
    - PTC 
    - Goiter
    - Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis 


- Q. Which drugs lead to false-positive calcitonin? 
    - Pantoprazole
    - Glucocorticoids 
    - Beta-blockers 


- Q. What calcitonin level in adults is considered suspicious for MTC?
    - basal calcitonin >20 pg/ml and pentgastrin >100 pg/ml is suspicious 
    - If pentagastrin is not available- basal >100 pg/ml – suspicious 


- **THYROID INCIDENTALOMAS**


- Q. Define thyroid incidentaloma? 
    - They are non-palpable thyroid nodules incidentally detected in tests done for other reasons 


- Q. Is it true, most incidentalomas detected on PET scans are malignant? 
    - Yes 


- Q. Which cystic nodules are more likely to be malignant? 
    - Ideally, all cysts >2 cm – the fluid should be aspirated and sent for cytopathology. Cysts more likely to be malignant are
        - Complex cyst
        - Bloody aspirate
        - Cyst accumulating after drainage 


- Q. What is done for an incidental lesion in the thyroid picked up by FDG PET? 
    - Focal uptake on FDG PET- increase risk of malignancy – if >1 cm – do FNAC
    - Diffuse uptake- less risk of malignancy- no FNAC
