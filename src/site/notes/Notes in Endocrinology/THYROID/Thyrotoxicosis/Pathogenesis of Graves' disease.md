- Q. Which organs have TSH receptors and hence are affected by TSH receptor antibodies in Graves’ disease?
    - Thyroid
    - Fibroblasts – including orbital fibroblasts
    - Adipocytes – including orbital adipocytes
    - Bone cells


- Q. What is the histopathological feature in Graves’ disease?
    - Patchy lymphocytic infiltration
    - Follicular hyperplasia
    - Reduction of follicular colloid


- Q. What is the nature of the lymphocytes?
    - They are mainly T cells
    - Some B cells may be present


- Q. Which antibody is associated with Graves’ disease?
    - TRAb
        - TSH receptor antibody – which is stimulating TSI (TSI- TRAb)


- Q. What is the class of TRAb?
    - It is an IgG1 antibody
    - It is oligoclonal, unlike TPO and Anti Tg, which are polyclonal


- Q. Does TRAb values help in the follow-up of a patient on ATD treatment?
    - Yes it does
    - At the time of discontinuation of ATD  if TRAb is high- chances of recurrence are hight


- Q. What happens to TRAb after radioactive iodine therapy?
    - Transient increase of TRAb- that’s why orbitopathy worsens
    - It normalizes in 3-5 months
    - Then slowly declines over years


- Q. What happens to TRAb after thyroid surgery?
    - The rapid decline in levels are seen
    - By 18 months- 80% of TRAb disappear after surgery


- Q. What are the types of TRAb antibodies?
    - Stimulating
    - Blocking
    - Neutral


- Q. What subtype of TRAb is seen in Graves’ disease?
    - A mixture of stimulating and blocking antibody- mainly stimulating antibody


- Q. Which are the specific T cells which are pathogenic in Graves’?
    - CD4+ Th1 cells – predominate
    - They produce IL2, TNF alpha, and Interferon-gamma
    - They activate CD8 T cell
    - CD4 Th2 are also present
    - Graves is a mixture of CD4 Th1 + Th2
    - Hashimoto’s is a predominantly Th1 disease


- Q. Which of these cytokines increases the production of TRAb antibodies?
    - Interferon-gamma is the main culprit here


- Q. Which are the costimulatory molecule for T Cell activation by APC in Graves, and which is it in type 1 diabetes?
    - Type 1 diabetes- costimulatory molecules are CD28 interacting with CD80 and 86
    - In Graves', it is CD40


- Q. Why does Graves’ disease become milder in pregnancy?
    - Because of the  increase of Treg – regulatory T cells


- Q. Which are the possible immune mechanisms which activate the autoimmunity in Graves’?
    - Three possible problems:
        - Molecular mimicry – bacterial heat shock protein, Yersinia, Retroviral sequences
        - Thyroid cell HLA expression
        - Bystander activation


- **Precipitating factors **


- Q. Which HLA subtypes are associated with Graves’ disease?
    - HLA-DR8 is associated
    - However, the association is weak, and hence typing is not useful


- Q. Can infections predispose to thyroid autoimmune disease?
    - Yes
    - Some have been implicated, like retrovirus and hepatitis C
    - However, none have been proven


- Q. Can stress precipitate Graves’?
    - Yes
    - Stress  increase cortisol → suppression of immunity → rebound hyperimmune response once cortisol is relived


- Q. Why do females have more Graves’ disease?
    - It is not exactly known
    - However, the moderate amount of estrogen stimulate autoimmunity – neither high nor low amounts


- Q. What is the relation of pregnancy with graves’?
    - Graves’ becomes milder in pregnancy
    - However, many new cases of Graves are precipitated in the postpartum period
    - The presence of fetal cells in the mother may be responsible- this is called Fetal microchimerism


- Q. Which drugs can precipitate Graves’ disease?
    - Iodine
    - Amiodarone
    - Almetezumab used in Multiple sclerosis
    - Interferon alpha- used in hepatitis C

- Q. Summarize the precipitating factors which can predispose to graves’ disease?
    - HLA subtypes and genes- HLA DR8
    - Female sex – moderate estrogen influence
    - Postpartum status – Fetal micromimicry
    - Infection- Yersinia, Retrovirus, hepatitis C
    - Drugs 
    - Smoking
    - Stress


- Q. Summarize the pathogenesis of Graves’ disease?
