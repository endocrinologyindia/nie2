- Q. Is it required to perform a thyroid scan in patients patients with thyrotoxicosis ?
    - While etiological evaluation for thyrotoxicosis is required in all cases, Graves' disease is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis
    - Patients can be clinically diagnosed to have Graves' disease when they have the following:
        - Long duration of symptoms
        - Thyroid associated orbitopathy
        - Diffuse goiter (with bruit)
    - It is prudent to perform a thyroid scan in the following group of patients
        - Recent onset of thyrotoxicosis (short duration of symptoms)
        - Absence of thyroid associated orbitopathy
        - Presence of a nodular goiter

    - Eye signs
        - Exophthalmos
        - Periorbital edema
        - Conjunctival edema
    - Pretibial myxedema 
    - Thyroid acropachy 


- Q. What are the causes of T3 toxicosis (high T3, Normal T4, low TSH)? 
    - Graves’ disease
    - Toxic MNG/ Toxic adenoma in iodine-deficient region
    - T3 ingestion 


- Q. What are the causes of isolated T4 toxicosis- increase T4, normal T3, and Low TSH? 
    - Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis
    - Thyrotoxicosis with Non-thyroidal illness
    - Exogenous T4 administration


- Q. How the diagnosis of Graves’ disease as a cause of hyperthyroidism established? 
    - Any one of the following
        - Clinical features classical Graves’ disease  - Graves ophthalmopathy, pretibial myxedema, or thyroid acropachy
        - Increase Radioactive iodine uptake
        - TRAb antibody positive
        - Increase blood flow in Doppler ultrasound of the thyroid gland 


- Q. What ratio of T3/T4 helps differentiate Graves’ disease from other causes of hyperthyroidism? 
    - T3/T4 > 20 
    - Free t3/t4 >0.3 


- Q. What are the causes of Low TSH without hyperthyroidism? 
    - Subclinical hyperthyroidism
    - Central hypothyroidism
    - Cushing’s syndrome- TSH suppression
    - Non-thyroidal illness
    - Pregnancy – because of HCG
    - Elderly – may have changed in set point of TSH
