- Q. Enlist the complications of Thionamides (Anti-thyroid drugs) ?
    - Common
        - Vomiting, nausea
        - Rash, urticaria
        - Arthritis, arthralgia
        - Fever
        - Abnormal taste sensation
    - Agranulocytosis
        - 0.1-0.5 % risk
        - Get CBC done at the start of therapy
        - Repeat CBC if c/o of fever, sore throat, etc
    - Liver disease
        - Methimazole, Carbimazole- cholestatic hepatitis
        - PTU – idiosyncratic liver failure
    - others
        - Teratogenicity -With methimazole
        - ANCA positive vasculitis – with PTU > Methimazole
        - Insulin autoimmune Syndrome (Hirata syndrome)- Methimazole
        - Pancreatitis- rarely with methimazole


- Q. What are the advantages of methimazole over PTU?
    - Longer half-life of 4-6 hours compared to 75 min of PTU
    - More intrathyroidal concentration
    - Superior blockage of TPO as evidence by perchlorate discharge test
    - PTU has a risk of idiosyncratic liver toxicity
    - PTU has more radioiodine failure


- Q. In which cases is PTU preferred over methimazole?
    - Pregnancy 1st trimester
    - Thyroid storm
    - Reaction of Methimazole (other than agranulocytosis) and not candidates for radioactive iodine


- Q. What is Neutropenia?
    - Neutropenia refers to a decrease in circulating neutrophils, which for adults corresponds to <1500 cells/microL in most clinical laboratories.


- Q. What is the normal neutrophil count? 
    - Normal neurotrophil in adults is 4400 to 11,000 cells/microL


- Q. What is the absolute neutrophil count?
    - Absolute neutrophil count – The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is the number of neutrophils plus bands but does not include metamyelocytes and less mature forms.
    - ANC = WBC (cells/microL) x percent (PMNs  +  bands) ÷ 100 


- Q. Please give the category of neutropenia 
    - Neutropenia can be categorized as:
        - Mild – ANC ≥1000 and <1500 cells/microL
        - Moderate – ANC ≥500 and <1000 cells/microL
        - Severe – ANC <500 cells/microL
        - Agranulocytosis – ANC <200 cells/microL
