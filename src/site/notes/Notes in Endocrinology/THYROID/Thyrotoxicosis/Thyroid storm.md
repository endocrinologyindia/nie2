- Q. What is the interpretation of the total score?
    - <25- thyroid storm unlikely
    - 25-44- support diagnosis
    - ≥ 45 = thyroid storm


- Q. What is the problem with these criteria?
    - They are sensitive but not specific


- Q. Is the degree of hyperthyroidism a criterion for thyroid storm?
    - No


- Q. Apart from the above score, which is another score that is used for thyroid storm?
    - Akamizu criteria


- Q. Describe the Akamizu criteria ?
    - Akamizu criteria are more specific but less sensitive

    - TS1- thyroid storm grade I
        - First combination
            - Thyrotoxicosis +
            - CNS manifestation +
            - Plus one or more of GIT, CVS, or fever
        - Alternate combination
            - Thyrotoxicosis + 3 or more of GIT, CVS, and fever
    - TS2
        - First combination
            - Thyrotoxicosis + 2 or more of the above combinations (Except CNS)
        - Alternate combination
            - Similar to TS1 first combination but t3, t4 not available at present, but the patient has a history of thyrotoxicosis from the previous report


- **Treatment **


- Q. Summarize the timing of medications in the management of thyroid storm as described by AACE guidelines
    - Timing
        - PTU, Cholestyramine, Methimazole (20 mg /4 hrly), and Propranolol- 4 hourly
        - SSKI- 6 hrly
        - Hydrocortisone – 8 hrly


- Q. What is the first step in the management of thyroid storm?
    - Propranolol – 60-80 mg every 4-6 hours
    - Adjusted according to heart rate and blood pressure
    - Alternate drug is esmolol


- Q. What is the role of beta-blockers?
    - Reduced HR
    - Reduced adrenergic symptoms
    - At high doses impairs T4 to T3 conversion


- Q. Which antithyroid drug is preferred in thyroid storm?
    - PTU
    - Because it also blocks T4 to T3 conversion
    - Dose is 500 mg -1000 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg every 4 hourly (guidelines say 250 mg)


- Q. What is an alternate to PTU?
    - Methimazole
    - Given 20 mg every 4 hourly


- Q. What is done 1 hour after ATD is administered ?
    - Iodine is given
        - SSKI- 5 drops 6 hourly or
        - Lugol’s – 10 drops 8 hourly


- Q. What is the role of iodine?
    - Blocks new hormone synthesis
    - Blocks release of thyroid hormone


- Q. Why is it given 1 hour after ATD?
    - To prevent iodine from being used as a substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis


- Q. What is the role and dose of hydrocortisone?
    - Hydrocortisone – 300 mg stat followed by 100 mg IV / 8hrly
    - Rationale
        - Treat subclinical adrenal insufficiency
        - Block t4 to t3 conversion
    - Dexamethasone can be an alternative


- Q. What is the role of bile acid sequestrants?
    - Cholestyramine is given in a dose of 4 gram every 4 times a day
    - It reduces enterohepatic circulation of thyroid hormone
    - It is available as CHOLTRAN powder for oral soln in a dose of 4 grams


- Q. What antipyretic is preferred in thyroid storm?
    - Acetaminophen and not aspirin


- Q. Why not aspirin (salicylates)?
    - Asporin (salicylates) prevents binding of t3 and t4 to TBG  hence increases the free hormone level
    - Salicylates increase metabolic rate


- Q. Which are other measures?
    - Treat the precipitating cause, especially infection
    - Correct fluid deficit- remember patient may have CCF, so be careful
    - Diuretics may be needed in CCF
    - Drugs may have to be given via RT if the patient has altered mentation


- Q. Can beta blocker be given IV?
    - Yes
    - Propranolol 1 mg/kg over 10 min - repeat very 4-6 hours
    - Metoprolol can also be given IV
    - Esmolol is given 250-500 mcg/kg loading dose followed by infusion of 100 mcg/kg/min
    - #Clinicalpearl
        - ATD blocks new thyroid hormone synthesis
        - Hence its action has a lag time of 1-2 hours


- Q. Which has a longer duration of action = PTU or Methimazole?
    - Methimazole has a longer duration of action


- Q. What is alternate means of giving PTU other than orally?
    - It can be given as enema or suppository
    - It can be given IV by dissolving it is in Normal saline made alkaline by adding sodium hydroxide
    - Methimazole can also be dissolved in neutral isotonic saline and passed through 0.22 um filter


- Q. What is done if ATD is absolutely contraindicated because of agranulocytosis or severe hepatotoxicity?
    - Emergent thyroidectomy may be required
    - Patient is treated with other medications for 5-7days and then taken up for surgery


- Q. Why does iodine inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis?
    - iodine blocking its uptake by NIS
    - Wolf Chiakoff effect- Iodine blocking organification of Tg


- Q. Which are other options for management?
    - Plasmapheresis
    - Use of iodinated contrast agent
    - Lithium


- Q. What kind of iodinated contrast is used, and what dose?
    - Iopanoic acid is used
    - It is used in a dose of 0.5-1 gram/day (500 mg BD)
    - It is the agent used on oral cholecystography
    - #Clinicalpearl
        - Iodine given orally can be irritating to GIT
        - Can be mixed with food or diluted in 240 ml liquid
    - #Clinicalpearl
        - Definitive therapy must be considered once the treatment for thyroid storm is done


- Q. What is the iodine content in Lugol’s solution?
    - 6 grams per drop (0.05 ml drop)


- Q. What about SSKI?
    - Ie 50 mg per drop (0.05ml)


- Q. Give an outline of the management of thyroid storm in pregnancy

- Q. Is there any guidance on obstetric management in these cases?
    - There is little or no data on the management of the obstetric aspect of thyroid
storm. 
    - The question of continuing the pregnancy should be decided based on
individual cases. 
    - It must be kept in mind that thyroid storm is a potentially
life-threatening condition of the mother


- Q. Where can I read more about the thyroid storm in pregnancy?

#Updates 

-   Q. Can thyroid storm occur after head and neck trauma ?
    -   Yes
    -   Though rare, thyroid storm has been reported from head and neck and neck trauma including
        -   Assault
        -   Suicide attempts by hanging and accidental self-inflicted injury
        -   following rapid sequence intubation ^[Ref: Radhi MA, Natesh B, Stimpson P, Hughes J, Vaz F, C Dwivedi R. Thyroid Storm in Head and Neck Emergency Patients. Journal of Clinical Medicine. 2020 Nov;9(11):3548]


-   Q. Can thyroid storm present with HCG producing tumors ?
    -   TSH and HCG have similar structure
    -   Hence excess of HCG can act on TSH receptor because of specificity spillover and can cause thyrotoxicosis
    -   Thyroid storm has been reported after HCG producing tumors
    -   Recently in male a HCG producing Testicular Choriocarcinoma has been reported to cause thyroid storm ^[Ref: Martínez-Gallegos JC, Ovalle-Zavala EA. Thyroid Storm Associated with Testicular Choriocarcinoma. European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine. 2020;7(10).]

Epidemiology and factors associated with mortality of thyroid storm in Taiwan: a nationwide population-based study. Internal and Emergency Medicine. 2021 Apr;16(3):601-7.]
        -   older age
        -   male sex
