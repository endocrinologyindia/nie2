- **Epidemiology **
    - Sex
        - It is more common in females
        - It is more severe in males
    - Age
        - More common in 40-60 years of age
        - More severe in elderly

---
- **RISK FACTORS **

---
- Q. What are the risk factors for GO ?
    - Age- older the age- worse the disease
    - Sex- more severe in males
    - TSH Receptor antibody- higher the titer- more severe the disease
    - Radioactive iodine therapy – may worsen the disease
    - Smoking – worsening of the disease

---
- **ASSOCIATION WITH THYROID DISORDER **


- Association with Grave's disease
    - 20-25% with Grave's disease have overt TAO
    - 30-40% of patients with Grave's disease may have changes on CT Scan or ultrasound but no overt disease

---
- Timing with Grave's
    - 20% - Precedes  hyperthyroidism
    - 40%- diagnosed concurrently
    - 20%- Follows the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism
    - 20%- Occurs after Radioactive iodine therapy

---
- With patients having TAO
    - 80%- Hyperthyroid
    - 10-20%- Euthyroid
    - 1-10%- Hypothyroid

---

- Q. What are the clinical features of optic neuropathy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy?
    - Loss of color vision
    - Disc swelling or optic atrophy
    - RAPD
    - Loss of visual acuity

---
- Q. How to test for RAPD? (Marcus Gunn Pupil)
    - Step 1
        - Ask the patient to fixate in the distance 
        - Ask him to hold the light source for 3 seconds in that position 
        - Assess the degree of contraction and how long it sustains.
    - Step 2
        - Now Move the light source to position 2 shown below. and hold for 3 seconds. 
        - Assess the degree of contraction and how long it sustains.
        - Compare with what you remember from the other eye.
    - Step 3
        - Move light source back to position 1 and hold for 3 seconds. Assess the degree of contraction and how long it sustains.
        - Compare with what you remember from the other eye.
    - Step 4
        - Repeat the swing from side to side until you are sure whether one side contracts less or sustains for less time (+ RAPD), or whether the pupil reflexes are equal in these respects (-RAPD).

---
- Q. What is RAPD suggest?
    - The presence of RAPD suggests compression of the optic nerve (proximal to the chiasma)

---
- Q. How is the retraction of eyelid measured?
    - Normally the upper eyelid covers the sclero-corneal junction by 1-2 mm. 
    - If the sclera is visible above the sclero-corneal junction – then there is at least 1.5 mm retraction and suggests upper eyelid retraction. 
    - Eyelid retraction >1-2 mm is significant.

---
- Q. What is the importance of upper eyelid retraction?
    - It is mainly due to sympathetic overactivity. It can be present in other causes of thyrotoxicosis other than Graves. It is one of the early signs of eye involvement.
---

- Q. Which other autoimmune diseases must be looked for while dealing with GOc?
    - Look for Ptosis, which may be associated with Myasthenia gravis.

---
- Q. What distance is measured by Hertel's exompthalmometer?
    - Between the lateral canthus of the eye and the orbital apex.
---

- Q.  What is the normal distance here?
    - Normal is 20 mm in whites and 22 mm in blacks.

---

- Q. How is the Bells phenomenon assessed?
    - Bells phenomenon is the rotation of the eyeball on the closure of the eyelid
    - Examiner holds the patient's eyelid tightly and asks her to attempt to close the eyes
    - The eyelid doesn't close, but the eyeball rotates upward
    - This is a normal bells phenomenon
    - Absent bells phenomenon is seen in 10 % of patients
    - They have a higher risk of corneal ulceration of eyelid doesn't close properly.

---
- Q. What is Lagophthalmos ?
    - Lagophthalmos is defined as the inability to close the eyelids completely. 
    - Ask the patient to look down and gently close both eyes. 
    - Lagophthalmos is present when space remains between the upper and lower eyelid margins in extreme downgaze. 
    - Document the degree of lagophthalmos by measuring this space, in millimeters, with a ruler. 
    - Also, record the blink rate as well as the completeness of the blink.

- **CLASSICAL THYROID EYE SIGNS**

---
- Q. Enlist the classical thyroid eye signs?
    - Dalrymple's sign – lid retraction- gives the patient a staring look
    - Von Gaffes' sign – lid lag in downgaze- ask the patient to look downwards- the upper lid lags behind the globe, exposing the sclera between the limbus and the eyelid
    - Stellway's sign- infrequent blinking and incomplete blinking + proptosis
    - Rosenbach's sign- the fine tremor of the eyelid on closure- esp the upper eyelid
    - Mobius sign- failure of convergence of eyes on accommodation
    - Kocher's sign- the reverse of von-grafe- on upward gaze the upper eyelid retract quickly
    - Joffroy's sign- absent wrinkling of the forehead when the eyes are looked up
    - Other lesser common
    - Saiton's sign- on looking upwards, the frontalis muscle contracts after the upper eyelid is fully retracted
    - Jellinek's sign- brownish pigmentation of upper-eyelid
    - Topolansky's sign- pericorneal congestion in patients with Graves disease

---
- Q. Which is the earliest sign to appear?
    - Lid retraction Dalrymple's sign
    - Normally upper eyelid covers the iris by >1 mm – it <1 mm or sclera see above the limbus – this sign is present
    - The upper sclera is seen- due to eyelid retraction
    - The lower sclera is seen- due to exophthalmos

---
-Q.  What is Gifford's sign?
    - Unilateral exophthalmos has to be differentiated from thyroid involvement vs. orbital tumor
    - Retract the eyelid of the patient
    - In Orbital tumor- you would be able to do so
    - In exophthalmos due to thyroid- it is not possible

---
- Q. What is the impact of treatment of Hyperthyroidism on GO ?
    - Impact of surgery and anti-thyroid drugs
        - Little impact on TAO severity
        - Hypothyroidism must be avoided- hypothyroidism will worsen the TAO
    - Radioactive iodine
        - Can potentially worsen the Ophthalmopathy
        - It can also lead to new onset of clinical GO, which was not present or noticed earlier
