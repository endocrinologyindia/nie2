        -  Cancer immunotherapy
    - • Radiation to CNS or thyroid

    - Antibodies against PD-L1 
        - **durvalumab**
        - atezolizumab
        - avelumab
- Q. How do tyrosine kinase inhibitors produce thyroid dysfunction ?
    - By two methods
        - 1. Increasing the requirement of levothyroxine in patients who are athyreotic
            - This is especially true with Imatinib and the dose of LT4 must be doubled in such patients when initiated on imatinib
            - Typically almost always occurs within 2 weeks of starting the drug
            - The enhanced thyroid hormone metabolism attributed to increased Type 3 deiodination.
        - 2. New onset of thyroid dysfunction
            - This is seen with Sunitinib and Sorafenib
            - TKI → inhibits VEGF → ischemic thyroiditis → thyroid dysfunction
            - This effect is often delayed and occurs about 4-94 weeks after starting the drug
- Q. Bexrotene is used in what patients ?
    - It is mainly used in patients with Cutaneous T cell lymphoma
    - It is a RXR agonist 
- Q. What type of hypothyroidism is seen with Bexarotene ?
    - Mainly central hypothyroidism
    - It is very rapid and occurs within hours 
    - It reduces TSH-beta gene transcription 
    - It can also suppress thyrotropes 
- Q. What is Alemtuzumab ?
    - Classification: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody.
    - Target: It is directed against CD52, a protein present on the surface of mature lymphocytes, but not on the stem cells from which these lymphocytes are derived.
    - Usage in Therapy:
        - It is used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple sclerosis (MS).
        - In CLL, it is used for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, particularly for patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and have failed fludarabine therapy.
        - In MS, it's administered to reduce relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
    - Mechanism of Action:
        - Induces lysis of lymphocytes through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement fixation.
        - Leads to profound lymphopenia, thus modulating the immune responses.
    - Administration: It is typically administered intravenously.
- Q. What kind of thyroid dyfunction is produced by Alemtuzumab?
    - It produces [[Graves' disease\|Graves' disease]] 
    - This is mainly because of IRIS or immune reconstitution
    - It is mainly seen in Multiple sclerosis patients given this drug
    - Typically occurs after 6-31 months after giving the therapy 
- Q. How is iodine given before MIBG scan ?
    - Lugol's iodine, 5-6 drops, 3-5 times/day, beginning 1 d before and till 6 d after therapeutic/diagnostic MIBG
- Q. What type of autoimmune diseases are seen with Cancer immunotherapy or [[Immune checkpoint inhibitors\|Immune checkpoint inhibitors]] therapy ?
    - Mainly those induced by T-cells
    - It mainly leads to T-cell activation and destruction of Cancer cells

- Q. Of the various immune check point inhibitors, what are the differential actions on various endocrine organs ?
    - [[CTLA-4 inhibitor\|CTLA-4 inhibitor]] - [[Ipilimumab\|Ipilimumab]] 
        -  more involvement of Pituitary^^
            - Pituitary gland expresses. CTLA-4 - hence more pituitary involvement 
            - Generaly occurs about 9 weeks after initiation of therapy 
    - [[PD1 inhibitor\|PD1 inhibitor]] - [[Nivolomumab\|Nivolomumab]] or [[Pembrolizumab\|Pembrolizumab]]  
        - more involvement of Adrenal and Thyroid #ClinicalPearl

- Q. How common is central hypothyroidism with [[Ipilimumab\|Ipilimumab]] ?
    - Almost 100% 
    - This drug is common in metastatic melanoma
    - Pituitary enlargement is almost commonly seen which resolves on discontinuation of the drug
- Q. What kind of thyroid dysfunction is seen with [[interferon alpha\|interferon alpha]] ?
    - Autoimmune thyroiditis- mainly hypothyroidism- rarely even Graves' disease
- Q. Summarize the thyroid dysfunction seen with various anti-cancer drugs 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FjIzbcdxZtr.png?alt=media&token=12d91970-99b7-4d24-894a-6bfdc02d9d46)
- Q. How should you monitor patients on [[Immune checkpoint inhibitors\|Immune checkpoint inhibitors]] ?
    - TSH, free T4, 8 am cortisol before x and before each cycle
    - Consider baseline MRI pituitary
    - Keep a close watch for mass effects, hyponatremia
    - Low threshold for hormonal evaluation and MR imaging
