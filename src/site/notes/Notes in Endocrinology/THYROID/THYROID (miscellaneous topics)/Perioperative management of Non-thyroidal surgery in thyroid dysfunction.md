- Q. Should perioperative thyroid function be done in all patients routinely?
    - No
    - Only in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and/or a history of prior thyroid disorder
- **Perioperative hypothyroidism management**
- Q. Which is the chief organ that must be taken care of in the Perioperative state in a Hypothyroid patient?
    - Cardiac involvement
    - Hypothyroidism affects cardiac function predominantly
- Q. What are the cardiac effects of hypothyroidism?
    - 1.	Increase Peripheral vascular resistance
    - 2.	Reduced cardiac contractility
    - 3.	Reduced cardiac output
    - 4.	Decreased blood volume
- Q. What are the effects of Hypothyroidism on the cardiac cycle?
    - The Projection phase is prolonged and the Ejection phase is narrowed
    - This leads to a reduction of cardiac output by 30-50% 
- Q. Why is there an increase in peripheral vascular resistance?
    -  T3  is thought to have a vasodilatory effect which is lost in hypothyroid patients
- Q. Why do hypothyroid patients become hypotensive on exposure to anesthetic agents?
    - This is because there is a loss of change of Cardiac output with the change of intrathoracic pressure and vasalva 
- Q. What are the effect of Hypothyroidism on catecholamines?
    - There is catecholamine resistance like effect
    - Catecholamines are increased by a reduced adrenergic tone
- Q. What type of tachyarrhythmia is seen in Hypothyroid patients perioperatively?
    - Torasdes de pointes 
    - Ventricular tachycardia is also sometimes seen
    - This is because of prolonged action potential
- Q. Which other test is a must in patients with Hypothyroidism as far as Cardiac function is concerned?
    - A lipid profile should be done
    - It is often abnormal and often associated with perioperative risk of cardiovascular disease
- Q. What is better in MI patients with Hypothyroidism? PTCA or CABG?
    - PTCA
    - Because hypothyroid patients undergoing CABG without achieving euthyroidism have more complications
- Q. What are the effects of Hypothyroidism on a respiratory drive?
    - Both hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory drive is blunted in hypothyroid patients
- Q. What is its effect on respiratory muscle action?
    - Respiratory muscle weakness  is generally seen in most patients 
- Q.  What is Hoffman’s syndrome?
    - Hypothyroidism with reduce muscle strength but increase muscle size 
- Q. Which other respiratory problem is common in hypothyroid patients?
    - Obstructive sleep apnea is common in hypothyroid patients
- Q. What is the problem of medicating in Hypothyroid patients in the perioperative period?
    - Patients with Hypothyroidism have reduced drug metabolism
    - Hence drugs that reduce respiratory function  often have prolonged action in these patients 
- Q.  What is the problem with respiratory in Hypothyroid patients who develop sepsis?
    - They have reduced respiratory surfactant development
- Q. Does  T3  have some role in Lung maturation?
    - It is observed that intra-amniotic  T3  administration in babies with a high risk of RDS, reduces the risk of RDS
    - PEARL: thyroid hormone induces surfactant synthesis
- Q. Is there an increase or reduced plasma volume in patients with Hypothyroidism?
    - Circulating volume is reduced
    - More fluid moves to interstitial space 
    - This is because of increased capillary permeability 
- Q. Which electrolyte imbalance is prominent in patients with Hypothyroidism?
    - Hyponatremia
    - ADH is often increases in these patients 
- Q. What is the effect on renal function in patients with Hypothyroidism?
    - Hypothyroidism reduces the renal perfusion
    - This may lead to worsening of renal function post-op
- Q. What is the most common CBC abnormality because of hypothyroidism?
    - Anemia
    - It is seen in 25-50% of patients with hypothyroidism
- Q. What type of anemia is commonly seen?
    - Normochromic normocytic
- Q. What is the effect of hypothyroidism on bleeding?
    - It increases the tendency to bleed
- Q. Which clotting factor is dysfunctional in patients with Hypothyroidism?
    - Factor VIII and they often have acquired von Willebrand factor deficiency 
- Q. What is the effect of Hypothyroidism on GI perioperatively?
    - Can often lead to ileus and constipation 
    - Some people called it myxedema ileus
- Q. What is the effect on QT interval?
    - Prolonged QT interval
- Q. Can hypothyroidism cause cortical insufficiency?
    - Yes
- Q. How much time does it take perioperatively for TSH to normalize?
    - 2 weeks after T4 administration 
- Q. Which is the induction agent of choice in Hypothyroidism?
    - Ketamine 
    - It has positive inotropic action and increases sympathetic activity 
- Q.  Which agent is not preferred?
    - Thiopental is not preferred
    - It increases systemic vascular resistance
- Q. In which cases  Central hypothyroidism  must be suspected ?
    - Patients undergoing neurosurgery for Sellar or nonsellar mass lesions
    - Patients with a history of traumatic brain injury 
    - History of cerebrovascular accident
- Q. How does hypothyroidism produce  hyponatremia ?
    - By increase of ADH
    - By increase of ANF- atrial natriuretic peptide
    - by decreased RAAS activity
- Q. What is the impact of uncontrolled hypothyroidism on coagulation?
    - It reduced coagulation by decreasing Factor VIII activity 
    - Increases the risk of bleeding
- Q. Give an algorithm for the management of perioperative hypothyroidism.

- **Perioperative thyrotoxicosis management**
- Q. What is the mainstay of perioperative thyrotoxicosis management?
    - the mainstay is good beta-blocker coverage
- Q. Are thioamides useful?
    - It is important to understand that thioamides block de novo synthesis of thyroid hormones and have little impact on already released hormone
    - Hence in immediate situations thioamides may not have a significant role
- Q. What is the advantage of PTU in this setting?
    - PTU blocks T4 -->  T3  conversion in this setting
    - However, it is not popular
- Q. What is the role of iodine in this situation?
    - Iodine is useful in blocking the release of thyroid hormones
    - However, it must be given only 1 hour after giving thioamides to prevent the iodine from being used as a substrate for de novo thyroid hormone synthesis 
    - This does not happen in Graves' disease but can occur in Toxic adenoma or Toxic MNG- hence in these situations it is better to give Thionamides first
- Q. What is done if a patient cannot take thionamides orally?
    - Can be given per-rectally also 
- Q. What kind of beta-blockers should be preferred?
    - Long-acting ones are better than short-acting ones
    - Hence Atenolol may be better as per this article
    - Starting dose of 25-50 mg and can go up to 200 mg 
    - Keep pulse <80
- Q. What type of anesthetic agent is given in a perioperative setting?
    - Sodium thiopental is preferred because it has anti-thyroid action
    - ketamine and ephedrine increase sympathetic activity and must be avoided 
- Pearl:
    - hypothyroid patient- prefer Ketamine
    - For hyperthyroid patients - prefer thiopental sodium 
- Q. What agent is preferred in this setting for reversing neuromuscular blockage?
    - Glycopyrrolate is preferred over atropine
    - It has less chronotropic action
    - Atropine may cause exaggerated tachycardia 
- Q. Why is Aspirin avoided in these scenarios?
    - They displace thyroid hormones from TBG and hence can precipitate a storm
- Summarize the approach to thyrotoxicosis in perioperative settings
