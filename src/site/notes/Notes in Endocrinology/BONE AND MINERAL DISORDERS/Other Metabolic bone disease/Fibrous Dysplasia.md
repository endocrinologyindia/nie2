- Q.  What is Fibrous dysplasia?

  - This is a condition in which a part of the bone is replaced by fibrous tissue. There is poorly formed trabecular bone.

- Q.  What causes this condition?

  - It is mainly due to postzygotic mutation in GNAS1 gene. Hence it is a part of McCune Albright syndrome.

- Q.  What are the clinical presentation of Fibrous dysplasia?

  - May present with severe disabling disease in early life to incidentally detect bone lesion to in later life.

- Q.  What are subtypes of FD based on number of bones involved?

  - Monostotic FD
  - Polyostotic FD
  - Panostotic FD all bones involved.

- Q.  Which mineral disorder is associated with polyostotic FD?

  - Hypophosphatemic rickets.

- Q.  What is the pathogenesis of FD?

  - Missense mutation in GNAS1 which encodes Gsalpha. 
  - Loss of intrinsic GTPase activity of Gs alpha. 
  - Continued action of adenylate cyclase. 
  - Continued production of cAMP.

- Q.  When does the mutation in the GNAS generally take place?

  - Generally post zygotic in inner cell mass stage.

- Q.  What is the pathophysiology in the bone in FD?

  - Normal bone is replaced by fibrous tissue. This tissue does not have any marrow and is obviously weaker than normal bone.

- Q.  So what has GNAS to do with FD?

  - Abnormal function of Gs alpha abnormal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell and abnormal function of mutated osteoblasts which are formed from it.

- Q.  What is the reason for osteomalacia seen along with it?

  - Mutated osteocytes excess FGF23 hypophosphetemic rickets.

**Clinical features**

Pearl: Most of the bone involvement is present before the age of 5 years.

- Q.  When are the patient most symptomatic?

  - Fractures are most likely to occur during the rapid phase of development ie during adolescence.

- Q.  What are the common symptoms?

  - Recurrent fracture Limp Pain.

- Q.  Which are common sites for pain?

  - Ribs Long bones Craniofacial bones Spine Pelvis.

- Q.  What produced long bone deformities?

  - Improper healing and improper treatment of fractures.

- Q.  What produces the craniofacial abnormalities?

  - Overgrowth of the sites of lesion.

- Q.  Which are the 2 most common sites of involvement?

  - Base of the skull Proximal metaphysis of femur.

- Q.  How does the femoral disease commonly present?

  - Limp Pain Fracture Deformity Shepard's crook deformity.

- Q.  What is the common lesion seen in Xray?

  - Expansile lytic bone lesion In the medullary space With thinning of the overlying cortex. This is the typical ground glass apperance.

- Q.  What is the importance of sclerosis in this lesion?

  - Some lesion can be sclerotic. Presence of sclerosis suggests active lesions.

- Q.  What are the facial deformities that occur?

  - Facial asymettry or bump on the face Malar prominence.

- Q.  Does the skull base involvement produce cranial nerve palsies?

  - It is very rare. Sometime vessels in the FD can bleed forming an aneursymal bone cyst which can expand the lesion and cause cranial nerve involvement.

- Q.  Why is it importnt to examine the spine in these patients?

  - FD can involve the spine. This can lead to scoloiosis. It can progress to a degree where it is lethal.

- Q.  Is malignancy seen in FD?

  - Rarely osteosarcoma can occur in the FD lesions. Q What is the role of surgery in FD It is indicated for pain or deformity or when there is fracture It is not indicated for cosmetic reasons
  - It is very rare for Osteosarcoma to occur. It mainly occurs in those exposed to high dose external beam radiation.

**Management**

- Q.  What is the role of bone scintigraphy in FD?

	-It can help predict the extent of the disease and functional outcome.

- Q.  What is done when there is fracture of the femur?

	-Insertion of intramedullary nails.

- Q.  What is the role of bisphosphonates in FD?

	- Reduces pain.
	- Improves radiographic apperance
	- Reduces fracture risk.
	- However, in trials only reduction of pain is seen.

- Q.  Which two drugs based on pathogenesis of the disease have been used in FD?

	-Toclizumab - it is an anti-IL6 drug developed mainly for Rheumatoid arthritis, since IL6 is involved in pathogenesis of FD, it can be used for this indication.
	Denusomab - it is an anti-RANKL antibody, again based on pathogenesis, it can be tried in FD.

- Q.  What is the new method for monitoring patients with Fibrous dysplasia?

	- Na-18F PET CT.

- Q.  What is the role of Denosumab in this condition?

	- Denosumab is thought to reduce pain like Bisphosphonates. However, the recent articles have also shown regression and stabilisation of the lesions. These case reports have used Denosumab every 3 monthly instead of 6 monthly.


- Q.  What is Mazabraud syndrome?

	-This is intramuscular myxoma with Fibrous dysplasia or McCune-Albright syndrome.


- Q.  What is the role of surgery in FD?

	-It is indicated for pain or deformity or when there is fracture. It is not indicated for cosmetic reasons.
