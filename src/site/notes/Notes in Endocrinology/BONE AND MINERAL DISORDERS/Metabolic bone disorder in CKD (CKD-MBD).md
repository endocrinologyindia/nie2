- **INTRODUCTION**


- Q. What is the definition of CKD – MBD? 
    - CKD-MBD is the metabolic bone disease typically seen at GFR <40 
    - It has three parts
    - a) Abnormal biochemical parameters- Abnormal Calcium, Phosphate, PTH
    - b) Abnormal bone metabolism - e.g., Adynamic bone disease
    - c) Extraskeletal Calcium deposition 


- Q. Give the sequence of events in the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD?

    - Pathogenesis factors for CKD-MBD
    - a) Phosphate retention 
    - b) Reduced production of Active vitamin D (Calcitriol)
    - c) Increased PTH
    - d) Increased FGF-23
    - e) Reduced FGFR1 and Klotho actions


- Q. What is the TMV system? 
    - Abnormalities of 
    - Turnover of bone

- Q. What are the advantages of non calcium over calcium containing phosphate binders? 
    - Less adynamic bone disease
    - Less vascular calcification
    - Less mortality 


- **MANAGEMENT OF HYPERPARATHYROIDISM IN CKD **


- Q. Describe the step wise management of hyperparathyroidism in CKD patient not on dialysis? 
    - 1. Correct the hyperphosphatemia
    - 2. Add Cholecalciferol and keep it in target of 30 ng/ml
    - 3. Add Add Calcitriol if PTH above target and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D is >30 ng/ml


- Q. What are the PTH targets for patient not on dialysis ? 
    - GFR:
        - 30-60 – PTH 35-70 pg/ml
        - 15-30 – PTH 70-110 pg/ml
        - <15  - PTH 150-300 pg/ml 


- Q. Summarize the targets in patient with Stage 5 CKD? 
    - Calcium- 8.5-9.5 mg/dl
    - Phosphate- 3.5-5.5 mg/dl
    - PTH- 150-300 pg/ml
    - Ca x P <55 


- Q. Describe the management of hyperparathyroidism in  CKD patient on dialysis? 
    - 1. Control the phosphate - get it in the target range with diet, drugs or dialysis
    - 2. Avoid hypocalcemia  → Correct the calcium if required 
    - 3. Recheck the PTH
        - if <150-300 pg/ml → follow-up the patient
        - If >300 pg/ml- move to step 4
    - 4. Additional drugs
        - If S. Calcium >8.5 mg/dl  → consider adding Cinacalcet (The use of Cinacalcet is considered controversial)
        - If S. Calcium <8.5 mg/dl → consider adding Calcitriol 


- Q. Give the summary for targets of various parameter at various stages for patient with CKD? 
    - GFR 30-60 
        - Calcium- 8.5-10.0 mg/dl
        - Phosphate- <4.5 mg/dl
        - PTH- 35-70 pg/ml
        - Monitor: 
            - PTH every 6-12 months
            - Calcium and phosphate- 6-12 months
            - 25 hydroxy vitamin D – annually

- Q. What exactly is "Renal osteodystrophy" ?
    - This is part of CKD-MBD
    - This mainly deals with Histomorphometric changes in CKD


- Q. What is the earliest abnormality that occurs in CKD-MBD ?
    - The earliest change that occurs is an increase in [[FGF23\|FGF23]] and a decline in its coreceptor [[Alpha-Klotho\|Alpha-Klotho]]


- Q. What is the relationship between [[FGF23\|FGF23]] and [[Alpha-Klotho\|Alpha-Klotho]]?
    - For the FGF23 to function it requires the presence of a co-receptor [[Alpha-Klotho\|Alpha-Klotho]]
    - Now, klotho is present only in Bones, kidneys and brain - hence other parts of the body are not affected by FGF23
    - Also Klotho gives negative feedback to FGF23 production keeping it in check
    
- Q. What happens as a consequence of FGF23 increase in Early CKD?
    - The increase in FGF23 is an adaptive process to control the phosphate retention
    - However because of the reduction of Klotho, though FGF23 increases, its effectiveness is reduced  
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2F9hXw1RYpuz.png?alt=media&token=d7c788a3-4f0e-4c45-a442-a3a21a91044f)
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FhOywczuisK.png?alt=media&token=5cda5673-2ba7-437a-b704-98c94895bb45)


- Q. What happens later in CKD?
    - Later on, the Klotho reduces so much, that FGF23 reduces its effect
    - Because of reduced Calcitriol and phosphate retention the negative feedback on PTH is reduced and hence PTH increases
    - Now the phosphate loss is dependent on PTH and not FGF23
    - Later on, though PTH is high, the nephron loss is so much that the effect of both PTH and FGF23 on nephron is lost and phosphate retention multiplies 


- Q. What happens to the WNT/Beta-catenin pathway?
    - CKD activates DKK1 and Sclerostin levels that inhibit the WNT/Beta-catenin pathway 
    - The above pathway is involved in bone formation 


- Q. What are the three major bone disorders seen in patients with CKD?
    - Though there are three entities - they are NOT distinct and a combination of the following always exists in patients with CKD
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FcTRNDeAzzZ.png?alt=media&token=60dbfc14-7861-4cd0-ad6d-599218842f1f)


- Q.  What happens to the cortical bones in CKD?
    - There is "Trabecularization" of the cortical bones in patients with CKD with an increase in trabecular volume


- Q.  What type of fractures are predominant in CKD? (Important pearl)
    - Patients with CKD have a loss of cortical bone
    - Non-vertebral and peripheral fractures predominate in such patients- areas having more cortical bone have a loss of the same leading to more fracture risk
    - Some people believe that perhaps the vertebral fractures are under-reported 


- Q. What are the other factors in patients with CKD that contribute to the bone disease?
    - 1. Use of unfractionated heparin in patients on dialysis
    - 2. Nutritional issues- anemia, sarcopenia, etc
    - 3. Gonadal dysfunction
    - 4. Associated Diabetes mellitus may contribute to the pathogenesis 


- Q. What is the gold standard for assessment of bone disease in patients with CKD-MBD?
    - Tetracycline labeled bone biopsy


- Q. Should a DEXA scan be done in patients with CKD?
    - In stages 1-3 of CKD, DEXA scan is a must 
    - However, the use of DEXA in CKD 4-5, especially for dialysis patients is debatable


- Q. What are the issues with using DEXA in CKD 4-5?
    - 1. The main problems here involve turnover issues and microarchitecture disturbances. Hence a DEXA may underestimate fracture risk
    - 2. Aortic vascular calcification may cause false high DEXA results in the vertebra


- Q. How to interpret DEXA in CKD 4-5?
    - Rely more on hip and radius compared to the vertebral BMD
    - Low Hip and Radius scores correlate with the risk of fracture in CKD patients


- Q. What are the roles of biochemical markers in this case?
    - Both P1NP and CTX are falsely high due to lower clearance of these markers in CKD
    - PTH and Bone specific alkaline phosphatase are useful, however a recent study has shown that it has a low predictive value for fractures


- Q. What is the impact of increased phosphate on bone turnover?
    - Phosphate reduces osteoclast reabsorption and osteoblast formation
    - It inhibits bone turnover
    - Hence overall, control of the phosphate levels should be a priority 


- Q. What should be the PTH targets in advanced CKD when using active vitamin D to suppress the PTH?
    - PTH value should be 2-9 times the upper limit of normal


- Q. Is there any role of calcimimetics at present?
    - Though they control the PTH levels, the evidence for their benefits in fracture reduction is not seen
    - Hence they are not recommended in Pre-dialysis patients


- Q. In patients in whom parathyroidectomy is recommended, does it improve bone outcomes?
    - Yes
    - Parathyroidectomy reduces the risk of fractures in CKD patients


- Q. If the patient is hypogonadal- should hormone replacement be suggested?
    - Yes and no
    - If there is a clearly defined cause for hypogonadism- hormone replacement must be done
    - For example, if the patient has low testosterone due to a defined pituitary cause- testosterone replacement must be done
    - For women SERMs may be preferred 


- Q.  What about the use of anti-resorptive agents?
    - Oral Alendronate has some data in CKD stages 3-4 and has shown fracture risk reduction
    - The FREEDOM trial for [[Denosumab\|Denosumab]] has evidence for CKD stages 3-4 as well and has shown good fracture reduction
    - There are small trials in dialysis patients with these drugs, but fracture data is missing 
    - Also in the larger trials, patients were not on dialysis and patients did not have mineral disorders - hence difficult to generalize to a more routine CKD population 


- Q. What about anabolic agents?
    - Small trials have shown benefits for these agents in CKD 
    - However, we need more data for the same
