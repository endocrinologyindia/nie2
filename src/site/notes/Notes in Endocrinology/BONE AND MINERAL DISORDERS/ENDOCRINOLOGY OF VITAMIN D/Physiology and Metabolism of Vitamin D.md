- Q. Give the pathway for vitamin D synthesis?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FE3P1c6_xYh.png?alt=media&token=bcb31fa3-c1e6-4953-b252-9862808b606b)


- Q. Which are the precursors of Vitamin D?
    - [[7-Dehydrocholesterol (Ra)\|7-Dehydrocholesterol (Ra)]]
    - [[Ergosterol (Rb)\|Ergosterol (Rb)]]


- Q. What happens to the vitamin D precursors in the presence of light?
    - In the presence of light, the vitamin D precursors undergo photoisomerization to [[Previtamin D\|Previtamin D]]
    - Previtamin D is an unstable compound and within 48 hours undergoes temperature-dependent molecular rearrangement to form [[Vitamin D\|Vitamin D]]


- Q. Why can't excess sunlight produce excess [[Vitamin D\|Vitamin D]]?
    - 1. Apart from the formation of [[Vitamin D\|Vitamin D]], the [[Previtamin D\|Previtamin D]] also isomerizes to inert compounds called Lumisterol and Tachysterol. This prevents all the previtamin D from converting to vitamin D
    - 2. The melanin in the skin darkens with sunlight reducing the penetration of UV rays and hence putting a brake on the first step of vitamin D synthesis dependent on the light


- Q. What timing of sunlight helps vitamin D formation?
    - 10-11 am to 2-3 pm


- Q. What is the impact of sunlight exposure on Vitamin D levels?
    - Sunlight exposure improves vitamin D level to about 4 ng/ml In children in summer with 30 min sunlight exposure with 15-30% of body surface area
    - However, there is little increase in vitamin D in Winters


- Q. What skin melanin category do Indians belong to?
    - Category I- European skin
    - Category VII- African skin
    - Indians- Category- IV or V


- Q. What are the primary dietary sources of vitamin D?
    - Fortified Cereals
    - Fortified dairy products
    - Egg yolk
    - Fish oil


- Q. Why do vitamin D levels decline with aging?
    - It is mainly due to reducing skin synthesis of vitamin D


- Q. How is vitamin D transported?
    - Vitamin D binding protein


- Q. What is the half-life of 25 hydroxyvitamin D?
    - 15 days


- Q. What are the pathway for genomic and nongenomic actions of vitamin D?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FuMqBSHPYou.png?alt=media&token=28a85dd6-b1a0-42c7-b045-8cf754563bfa)


- Q. What are the names of plant and animal sources of vitamin D? Which is more potent?
    - Plant- Ergocalciferol- vitamin D2
    - Animal- [[Cholecalciferol\|Cholecalciferol]]- vitamin D3
    - Both are equipotent


- Q. Where does vitamin D after it is absorbed?
    - Vitamin D is transported via a lymphatics
    - it is bound to[[ Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)\| Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)]]and Albumin while in circulation
    - It goes to the liver, where it is converted to its storage form [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]]


- Q. Apart from [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]], what else binds to the [[ Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)\| Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)]]?
    - [[1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D\|1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D]] also binds to the VDBP


- Q. What happens to animal models having deficiency of [[ Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)\| Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)]]?
    - These mice have an increased tendency for toxicity due to [[1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D\|1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D]]
    - It also leads to [[Vitamin D Deficiency\|Vitamin D Deficiency]]


- Q. What does the polymorphism in the biding of [[ Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)\| Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)]] produce?
    - It leads to vitamin D deficiency in a specific subset of patients


- Q. Which is the principal storage form of vitamin D, and what is its half-life?
    - Storage form is [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]]
    - Half-life is 15 days


- Q. Give the definitions of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency?
    - Vitamin D levels
        - Deficiency <20 ng/ml
        - Insufficiency – 20-29 ng/ml
        - Sufficiency – 30-100 ng/ml
        - Toxicity – >150 ng/ml
       


- Q. Give the cutoffs for vitamin D in nmol/l
    - <30 nmol/l – inadequate
    - 30-50- insufficiency
    - 50-75- sufficiency
    - 75-125- no benefit of replacement
    - More than 125- toxicity


- Q. Where do these levels for normality come from?
    - They are based on when the PTH level rises
    - Hence they are correlated with PTH level


- Q. Which antitubercular drug reduces the 25 hydroxylations of vitamin D?
    - Isoniazid
    - This is because 25 hydroxylation of Vitamin D is a [[Cytochrome P450\|Cytochrome P450]] like enzyme


- Q. How does vitamin D reduce blood pressure?
    - Vitamin D reduces renin and hence reduces the blood pressure


- Q. What is [[megalin\|megalin]] and what is its importance in vitamin D metabolism?
    - Megalin is also called LRP2
    - it is a type of receptor
    - antibodies against megalin have been implicated in membranous nephropathy
    - [[ Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)\| Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)]] is filtered by glomeruli and reabsorbed by megalin
    - Deficiency of megalin leads to loss of VDBP leading to severe [[Vitamin D Deficiency\|Vitamin D Deficiency]]
    - It is also thought to cause reuptake of [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]] from that filtered by the kidney


- Q. Why is there [[Vitamin D Deficiency\|Vitamin D Deficiency]] in [[nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]]?
    - In [[nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]] also there is loss of [[ Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)\| Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)]]
    - This leads to deficiency of vitamin D


- Q. Do [[1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D\|1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D]] level impact [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]] levels?
    - Yes
    - Increased conversion to [[1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D\|1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D]] leads to lower [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]] levels

            - [[klotho\|klotho]] is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KL gene. 
            - There are three subfamilies of klotho: α-klotho, β-klotho, and γ-klotho.
            - α-klotho activates [[FGF23\|FGF23]], and β-klotho activates FGF19 and FGF21.[7] 
            - When the subfamily is not specified, the word "klotho" generally means the α-klotho subfamily

			A --> B[Activate Vitamin D receptor]
			B --> C[Produce cathelicidin]
			C --> D[This has antimicrobial property]
			D --> E[Kills intracellular mycobacteria]
     ```



    - Q. What is the role of the 24 hydroxylase enzyme?
        - This converts 25 hydroxyvitamin D to 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D 
        - This is an active form of hormone
