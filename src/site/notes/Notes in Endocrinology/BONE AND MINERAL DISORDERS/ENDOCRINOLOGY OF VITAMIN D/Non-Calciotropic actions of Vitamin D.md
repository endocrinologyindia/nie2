    - Q. Summarize the actions of vitamin D on the muscle?
        - Vitamin D may have non-genomic actions on muscles

        - In recent experiments – treatment with vitamin D increased the number of vitamin D receptor in the muscle by 29%


    - Q. What are the evidence of the indirect impact of vitamin D in muscles?
        - 1. Some studies have shown the clear absence of vitamin D receptors in muscles and have challenged this notion
        - 2. not all patients with low vitamin D have myopathy
        - 3. some experiments have shown knock out of intestinal vitamin D receptor leads to muscle atrophy
        - A high dose of calcium can reverse features of [[osteomalacic myopathy\|osteomalacic myopathy]] in some patients
        - High PTH can lead to myopathy and poor contractility


    - Q. What does RCT for vitamin D supplementation say?
        - There is a meta-analysis that says that if the starting vitamin D is <10 ng/ml- there is an improvement in the muscle function with treatment
        - However, If the starting vitamin D > 10 ng/ml, there is a slight improvement in muscle function with treatment
        - Another RCT explored the role of vitamin D in preventing falls

                - By reducing Renin and Modulating RAAS
                - Increase calcium flux into the cell which improves transduction pathway
                - Increase Osteocalcin production by bone  increase adiponectin
