- Q. Give the Recommended daily allowance of vitamin D? 
    - infants- 400 IU
    - Children- 600 IU
    - Adults (<70 years)- 600 IU
    - Elderly (>70)- 800 IU
    - Pregnant and Lactating- 600 IU 


- Q. What is the tolerable upper limit of vitamin D? 
    - Infant 0-6 months- 1500 IU
    - Infant 6-12 months- 2500 IU
    - Child 1-5 years – 3000 IU
    - Child >5 years and adults – 4000 IU 
    - However, short term ingestion of 10,000 IU / day poses no risk 
        - Dose >10,000 IU/day – toxicity can occur 


- Q. What are symptoms of vitamin D toxicity? 
    - Acute or Subacute toxicity
        - Neurological symptoms- confusion, coma, muscle weakness
        - Nephrogenic Diabetes insipidus 
            - polyuria
            - polydipsia
        - GI symptoms
            - anorexia
            - vomiting
    - Chronic toxicity
        - nephrocalcinosis
        - nephrolithiasis
        - bone demineralization


- Q. Does excess vitamin D increase the risk of falls? 
    - Yes
    - Some recent studies have shown that excess vitamin D increases the risk of falls. 


- Q. How is calcium reabsorbed in the thick ascending loop of Henle? 
    - The Na-K ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane drives 3 Na molecules out of the cell while two potassium molecules come in.
    - Na-K-2Cl (furosemide sensitive Na channel) allows Na, K, and 2 Cl reabsorption – which is an electrically neutral process.
    - Now cell has extra potassium, which is leaks out into the lumen
    - Since Na is being pumped out and K is leaking out, there is a net negative charge inside the cell
    - This allows Ca to enter the cell 


- Q. How does the Calcium sensing receptor receptor (CaSR) act in this area? 
    - Increase calcium → activation of CaSR → generation of arachidonic acid metabolite → suppress the Na-K ATPase pump → blocks the leaking potassium channel
    - This disrupts the entire process, and hence calcium cannot be reabsorbed. 


- Q. What are the lab findings of vitamin D toxicity? 
    - Increase calcium
    - Increase Phosphate
    - Increase creatinine
    - Dilute urine
    - Hypercalciuria
    - Reduce PTH 
    - Short QTc on ECG


- Q. What level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D predisposes to toxicity?
- Guidelines say >150 ng/ml leads to toxicity.
    - However, current evidence says >80 ng/ml can predispose to toxicity
    - However, toxicity depends on the amount of calcium intake, and hence all people with this level of vitamin D don’t develop toxicity 
    - This has to be kept in mind 


- Q. What produces hypercalcemia in hypervitaminosis of D ? 
    - Increase intestinal absorption
    - Increased bone resorption 


- Q. Which vitamin D analogs can cause vitamin D toxicity? 
    - All of them can cause
        - Calcitriol- highest risk
        - Paracalcitol- lowest risk 


- Q. What is the difference in toxicity due to 25 hydroxyvitamin D and Calcitriol? 
    - The duration of toxicity
    - Since calcitriol has a short half-life- the duration of toxicity is shorter but produces more acute symptoms 


- Q. What is the duration of toxicity of various vitamin D compounds? 
    - 25 hydroxyvitamin D- 15 days
    - Alpha D3- 5 days
    - Calcitriol- 2-5 days 


- Q. What is the management of patients with Vitamin D toxicity? 
    - Patients without renal failure
        - Stop vitamin D and analogs 
        - Isotonic fluids +/- furosemide
        - Glucocorticoids 
    - Patients with renal failure
        - Stop offending drug
        - Fluids +/- diuretics if required
        - Glucocorticoids
        - Hemodialysis with low calcium bath (if required) 


- Q. How does Glucocorticoid help? 
    - Reduces intestinal absorption of calcium 
    - Reduce 1 alpha-hydroxylase – reduce activation of vitamin D 


- #Real-life-cases
    - An elderly female had pain in her joints secondary to osteoarthitis 
    - She was prescribed a plethora of Vitamin D compounds in inappopriate doses including Calcitriol and calcium
    - Presented to the emergency in coma with hypercalcemia and vitamin D toxicity 
    - The PTH value was 8 pg/ml suggesting PTH independent hypercalcemia
