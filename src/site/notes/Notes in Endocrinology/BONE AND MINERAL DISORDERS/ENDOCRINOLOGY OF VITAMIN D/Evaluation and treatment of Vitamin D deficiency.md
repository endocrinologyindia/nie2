- **Laboratory Assessment of Vitamin D**

- Q. Which is the principal storage form of vitamin D, and what is its half-life?
    - Storage form is [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]]
    - Half-life is 15 days


- Q. Give the definitions of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency?
    - Vitamin D levels
        - Deficiency <20 ng/ml
        - Insufficiency – 20-29 ng/ml
        - Sufficiency – 30-100 ng/ml
        - Toxicity – >150 ng/ml
       


- Q. Give the cutoffs for vitamin D in nmol/l
    - <30 nmol/l – inadequate
    - 30-50- insufficiency
    - 50-75- sufficiency
    - 75-125- no benefit of replacement
    - More than 125- toxicity


- Q. Where do these levels for normality come from?
    - They are based on when the PTH level rises
    - Hence they are correlated with PTH level


    - Q. Which is better for Vitamin D assessment- [[immunoassay\|immunoassay]] or mass-spectrometry?
        - Mass spectrometry is more reliable
        - This is because immunoassay has a lot of variation


    - Q. Which correlates better with signs and symptoms of vitamin D deficiency- [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D\|25-Hydroxyvitamin D]] level or [[1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D\|1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D]]?
        - 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels correlate better with clinical features of vitamin D deficiency
