    - Developing hypergonadotropic hypogonadism before the age of 40 years
    - ESHRE criteria for POI
    - FSH >25 mIU/ml – measured on two occasions 4 weeks apart
    - Amenorrhea for >4 months

    - Occult
    - Biochemical
    - Overt


- Q. What are occult POI and overt POI?
    - Occult POI- subtle changes were leading to infertility despite regular menstrual cycles. They have an inadequate response to exogenous or endogenous gonadotropins
    - Overt POI- Oligo/amenorrhea+ anovulation + Increased FSH


- **Etiology**

- **Genetic causes **


- Q. What is the most common cause of POI?
    - Turner syndrome
    - Occurs in  1:2500 live births


- Q. Is the defect seen in Turner syndrome because of accelerated destruction of the ovaries, or is it because of abnormal development of ovaries?
    - Accelerated destruction is most likely
    - Up to 12 weeks of Intrauterine life, the number of follicles is normal

    - CGG


- Q. Which number of repeats is associated with disease
    - <40- normal
    - 40-55- gray zone
    - 55-200- called Premutation and associated with POI
    - More than200- full mutation and full phenotype, including Mental retardation, is seen


- Q. Do women with premutation have early menopause?
    - Yes


- Q. How common is Fragile X premutation ?
    - Very common
    - 1 in 259 women has it 


- Q. What are the ACOG recommendations for screening for permutations?
    - It is recommended that all women with POI must be screened for premutations


- Q. What is the cause of POI is galactosemia?
    - It is because of the toxic effect of galactose


- Q. Name some other genes leading to POI?
    - FOXL2
    - STAG3
    - FIGLA


- Q. What is the role of BMP15 in follicular growth?
    - BMP15 aids in granulosa cell proliferation


- Q. How does BMP15 mutation lead to POI?
    - Mutant BMP15 suppresses the action of normal BMP15 leading to reduced follicular growth


- Q. Which syndrome presents with teletelangiectas, abnormal gait, and POI?
    - Ataxia telangiectasia

    - FOXL2 mutation
    - BPES syndrome (blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome [BPES])




- **Autoimmune etiology **


- Q. Which autoimmune polyglandular syndrome- type 1 or type 2 is associated with POI?
    - Both
    - Occurs in 40% in each case


- Q. Is there any difference in isolated autoimmune POI vs. POI associated with APS?
    - Yes
    - Isolated POI is associated with WBC in the theca cells
    - The primordial follicles per se are spared
    - There is a spillover to the primordial follicles, which causes the disease


- **Ovarian toxins **


- Q. Which drugs are associated with POI?
    - Chemotherapeutic agents are primary the cause
    - They include alkylating agents and cyclophosphamide
    - Platinum containing agents also produce the same


- Q. Does smoking cause POI?
    - It produces early menopause
    - Hence POI may also be possible


- **ABNORMAL FOLLICULAR STIMULATION (POI WITHOUT FOLLICLE ATRESIA) **


- Q. Which conditions, in general, produce POI without follicular atresia?
    - They are mainly seen in syndrome associated with abnormal estradiol synthesis
    - It is a synthesis defect


- Q. Is there any role of paracrine factors?
    - Yes
    - Various paracrine factors have been identified which inhibit ovarian estradiol release
    - One such is a polymorphism of the alpha subunit of inhibin


- Q. Which disorder of steroid synthesis present with POI?
    - StAR defect
    - 17 alpha-hydroxylase
    - Aromatase defect


- Q. Can pseudohypoparathyroidism also have POI?
    - Yes
    - This is because of LH/FSH resistance
    - Because of the Gs alpha subunit defect


- **Clinical features of Premature ovarian insufficiency**


- Q. Summarize the Clinical features of POI?
    - Oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea
    - Anovulation

    - Menstrual irregularities
    - Oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea


- Q. A woman present with failure of return of menses after stopping OC pills, can she have POI?
    - Yes
    - Because often the OC pills mask the symptoms of POI
    - Hence the women may be having POI but did not know because of OC pills
    - Reveals itself when OC pills were stopped


- Q. Which are the symptoms of estrogen deficiency?
    - Vaginal dryness
    - Hot flushes


- Q. What about psychological health?
    - They have an effect on their emotional health also

    - Elevated FSH
    - Low estradiol


- Q. When to measure FSH?
    - Menstruating women- day 3 of cycle
    - Women having Amenorrhea- anytime


- Q. What are typical TVS features in POI?
    - Enlarged cystic ovaries


- Q. What are the diagnostic criteria for POI?
- ESHRE criteria
    - Age <40 years
    - FSH >25 mIU/ml – measured on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart
    - Amenorrhea for >4 months


- Q. Is amenorrhea a prerequisite to the diagnosis of POI?
    - No
    - Occult POI may have a regular menstrual function
    - Diagnosis of POI does not require the presence of [[Amenorrhea\|Amenorrhea]]


- Q. How is the diagnosis of occult POI made?
    - FSH is in the range of 10-15 pg/ml
    - AMH and antral follicular count on TVS can be used for the assessment of ovarian function


- Q. Can progesterone withdrawal bleeding help rule it out?
    - No
    - It is falsely reassuring
    - It is no substitute for good biochemical testing


- Q. What other tests are needed to rule out other causes?
    - HCG for pregnancy
    - Prolactin


- **Additional evaluation once the diagnosis is established **


- Q. What clues from history would you get for possible etiology?
    - Family history /personal history of autoimmune disease-  APS syndrome
    - Family history of POI- think of genetic syndromes
    - Family history of Mental retardation, POI, early menopause, parkinsonism, intention tremors- like fragile X premutation
    - History of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy – ovarian damage


- Q. How common is adrenal insufficiency found in women with spontaneous POI?
    - In 3% of cases


- Q. Should adrenal antibodies be measured in all women with POI?
    - Ideally, you should
    - The test is 21 hydroxylase antibody
    - Similarly, a thyroid function test also must be done on them


- Q. Is ovarian biopsy recommended?
    - No


- Q. Should karotype be done in all women with POI ? Is there a specific age cut off for the same ?
    - Yes
    - It should be offered to all women with POI
    - Karotype abnormality are seen in 10-12 % of women with POI
    - No age cut off is determined since about 30% of women with POI having abnormal karotype were detected after the age of 30 years.


- Q. Why is important to look for Y chromosonal material in the karotype ?
    - This is because it increases the risk of gonadal neoplasia
    - If Y chromosome material is found - consider gondectomy 


- Q. How to accurate assess for Y chromosomal material ?
    - By incorporating FISH or PCR along with the karotype in women with POI


- Q. Apart from katypotype what is the other method for diagnosis of Turner syndrome ?
    - Array CGH (Microarray-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH))

    - Yes
    - Genetic testing for FMR1 must be done in all women with POI


- Q. What about DEXA?
    - DEXA must be done in all women with POI at the time of diagnosis


- **AUTOIMMUNE POI**


- Q. Is an anti-ovarian antibody for diagnosis of autoimmune POI recommended ?
    - It has an unacceptably high false positive rate
    - Hence it is not generally done
    - 21-hydroxylase antibody may be done instead 


- #Clinicalpearl
    - It is recommended to do 21 hydroxylase and anti adrenal antibody in all patients with POI
    - This will help diagnose autoimmune oophoritis also


- Q. What are the characteristic features of autoimmune oophritis?
    - Destruction of theca cells and not of granulosa cell
    - 21 hydroxylase antibody positive
    - Enlarged cystic ovaries on ultrasound


- Q. What is the difference in the biochemical signature of Autoimmune oophoritis vs. other POI?
    - Inhibin B is high in autoimmune. It is low in other cause of POI
    - LH is more elevated, and FSH is relatively less elevated, unlike in other causes of POI


- Q. What are the histological features?
    - Lymphocytes involving theca cells and antral follicles
    - Primordial follicles are spared


- Q. What is the test to label the patient with Autoimmune oophoritis?
    - For autoimmune oophoritis also 21 hydroxylase antibody is the test of choice
    - Anti ovarian are not validated
    - Anti – TPO are non specific


- Q. Should [[Thyroid function test\|Thyroid function test]] be done in all patients with autoimmune oophoritis?
    - Yes


- Q. What is an experimental therapy for the treatment of autoimmune oophoritis?
    - Use of prednisolone in the dose of 20-40 mg for 1-6 months

    - Diminished well being
    - Depression
    - Reduced cognition
    - Osteopenia/osteoporosis
    - Increase CV risk
    - Infertility


- Q. What is the first-line therapy for POI?
    - Estrogen replacement with progesterone (if the uterus is intact)


- Q. How long is it given?
    - Till natural age of menopause


- Q. What is the factor on which you will decide the dose of Estrogen?
    - Whether it is primary or secondary amenorrhea
    - For primary – start with a low dose to mimic normal puberty


- Q. What is the starting dose of Estrogen for these women?
    - Transdermal estrogen (Estraderm Mx)- 100 mcg daily
    - Oral 17 beta estradiol – Progynova- 2 mg
    - Congjugated equine estrogen- Premarin – 1.25 mg
    - Ethinyl estradiol- Lynoral- 10 mcg


- Q. Can [[Menopause hormonal therapy\|Menopause hormonal therapy]] be given in women who are [[BRCA\|BRCA]] 1 or 2 positive ?
    - It can be given in those women not having a personal risk of [[breast cancer\|breast cancer]] only after performing bilateral salphingo-ophrectomy


- Q. Which is the progesterone and the dose?
    - Medroxyprogesterone (Meprate) – 10 mg for 12 days of the cycle
    - This reduces endometrial hyperplasia and prevents endometrial cancer


- Q. Does micronized progesterone protect from [[Endometrial cancer\|Endometrial cancer]] ?
    - > The benefits of protection from Endometrial carcinoma is maximum from [[OCP\|OCP]] and less from micronized progesterone 


- Q. What are the advantages of transdermal preparations ?
    - Reduces the first-pass metabolism  so it allows for less dose
    - Reduces CV effects
    - Reduces procoagulant effect- less risk of thrombosis
    - Provides 17 beta-estradiol whic is more physiological
    - More steady estradiol level
    - Permits measurement of estradiol
    - Fewer GI effects on the gall bladder


- Q. Does this regime have a contraceptive effect
    - No !!
    - It is suboptimal for contraception
    - Hence an alternative contraceptive has to be used


- Q. Why  are OC pills not used in place of the current Estrogen + progesterone?
    - Effect on the bone with OC pills is suboptimal


- Q. What are the risks of serious long-term effects in POI treated with HRT vis a vis postmenopause?
    - POI patients are at higher CV risk if not treated compared to postmenopausal women
    - They have low baseline CV risk and breast cancer risk  hence these side effects are not a problem. Treating them reduces CV risk than increasing it


- Q. We need androgens for these women?
    - Along with the reduction of Estrogen, they also have a decrease in ovarian androgens
    - Do we need to replace ovarian androgens to improve sexual function is debatable
    - However, currently, there is less evidence favoring the use of testosterone in these women
    - Remember, adrenals are normal, so the  issue of DHEA-S supplementation is not there
    - Those with adrenal insufficiency- DHEA may be given


- Q. How common is the presence of adrenal antibodies in these women, and what is the risk of adrenal insufficiency?
    - About 3% of them have 21 hydroxylase antibodies
    - 50% of patients with antibody-positive develop Adrenal insufficiency
    - Hence if antibodies are positive- check morning cortisol and ACTH


- Q. If antibodies are negative, is repeat testing required
    - Generally No
    - But the patient should be told about symptoms of AI


- Q. What is the best option for fertility in women with POI?
    - IVF with donor oocytes
    - Or Embryo donation


- Q. Is ovulation induction advised?
    - No


- Q. What are the chances of spontaneous ovulation?
    - <4%


- Q. Does giving Estrogen improve fertility outcomes?
    - Generally no, but some studies show favorable effect, especially with transdermal preps
    - Gonadotropin + Estrogen may be more effective. However, limited experience
    - No benefit of GnRH + Estrogen


- Q. What is the reason for poor ovulation in these women?
    - Inappopriate follicular leutinzation


- Q.  Can [[Menopause hormonal therapy\|Menopause hormonal therapy]] be given to women who have undergone oophorectomy for [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Endometriosis\|Endometriosis]] ?
    - Yes 


- Q. Which is the best form of estrogen for women having [[migraine\|migraine]] ?
    - Transdermal estorgen
    - Transdermal estrogen is also the preffered choice in women having hypertension
    - Also for patients with past history of [[Venous thromboembolism\|Venous thromboembolism]]
    - Also for obese women ! 


- Q. Are [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Fibroids\|Fibroids]] contraindication for [[Menopause hormonal therapy\|Menopause hormonal therapy]] ?
    - No


- Q. Can [[OCP\|OCP]] be used for pubertal induction ?
    - No
    - It is contraindicated ! 


-   Q. Can follicular development still take place in patients with Primary ovarian insufficiency?
    -   Yes
    -   Intermittent follicular development can be seen in patients with POI


-   Q. What is the importance of FSH in the follicular phase in women with infertility?
    -   FSH 1 SD above mean in follicular phase even though the patient has regular cycles may indicate waning fertility
    -   It is an early presentation of ovarian failure


-   Q. What are the chances of fertility in such cases?
    -   Chances of fertility are low despite having regular menstrual cycles of intermittent follicular development


-   Q. What is Fragile X premutation, and what is its importance in POI?
    -   Women having an increased number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene are at risk of POI
    -   If there are 55-200 repeats, then the woman is said to have Fragile X premutation. They have the risk of POI and having a mentally retarded offspring
    -   If there are more than 200 repeats – there are chances of complete Fragile X mental retardation syndrome


-   Q. Why is it important to test for this mutation in women with POI?
    -   If they use ART and conceive a child- there is the risk of mental retardation in the offspring
    -   They are themselves at risk of developing ataxia dementia syndrome in old age
    -   Other family members may be carrying a similar mutation, and hence testing may help in their genetic counseling as well


-   Q. What is the need to do Karyotype in women with POI?
    -   Women with POI with age <35 years maybe Mosaic Turner’s
    -   Hence Karyotype must be done in such patients and screened for complications of Turner’s


-   Q. What type of APS develop POI?
    -   APS I and II


-   Q. Should ovarian antibodies be tested in women with APS?
    -   They are not required.
    -   Ovarian antibodies are not specific for Autoimmune POI


-   Q. What is the appearance of ovaries in Autoimmune ovarian failure?
    -   They are cystic appearing or normal


-   Q. Which part of the ovary is damaged first in autoimmune ovarian failure, and what is spared?
    -   Theca cells are damaged first, and the granulosa cell layer is preserved


-   Q. What are the chances of pregnancy with POI?
    -   They are limited
    -   These women may have spontaneous follicular development, but chances of pregnancy are minimal
    -   Oocyte donation is the best option


-   Q. Are glucocorticoids helpful in autoimmune ovarian failure?
    -   They are anecdotal reports of its use


-   Q. Is there any therapy which can increase the chances of spotenous ovulation ?
    -   Some studies have shown that estrogen therapy can increases the chances of spotenous ovulation
        -   Data for the same is mixed
        -   It is generally beneficial in women with shorter duration of amenorrhea
        -   Also transdermal and vaginal estorgen may be more beneficial
        -   Some suggest suppressing FSH <15 may be helpful in this scenario
    -   Exogenous gonadotropins have NOT found to be effective
        -   Some studies have shown initial suppression with Ethinyl estradiol to FSH <15 then stimulation with HMG/rFSH has been found to improve fertility
        -   GnRH agonist therpy - not effective
        -   Glucocorticoid therapy - also unproven


    -   Q. What is the role of oocyte donation ?
        -   Oocyte donation is found to be effective in this scenario
        -   this is the best option for these women


    -   Q. Can a sister of the patient be a potential oocyte donor ?
        -   The chances of failure are more with sister as a oocyte donor


    -   Q. Are obstetric complications higher in women conceiving via an oocyte donation ?
        -   Yes
        -   More risk of Small for gestational age, PIH and Post partum hemorraghe


    -   Q. How frequently is BMD-DEXA done in women with POI ?
        -   At the time of diagnosis
        -   Repeat every 5 years
