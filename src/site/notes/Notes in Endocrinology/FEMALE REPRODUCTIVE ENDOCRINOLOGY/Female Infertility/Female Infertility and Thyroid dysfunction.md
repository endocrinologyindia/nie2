- Q. Is there a link between thyroid dysfunction and infertility?
	- Yes
	- Current evidence suggests a definite link between over thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism) and infertility and substantial improvement in fertility with treatment.


- Q. Summarize the approach to a woman with thyroid dysfunction and having a history of recurrent first-trimester abortion?

- Q. Summarize the evidence available for Anti TPO positivity and fertility outcomes 
	- ![][image-2]


- Q. Is it true that women with PCOS are more likely to have anti-TPO antibody-positive?
	- Yes


- Q. Is it true that women with Anti TPO positive with or without TSH elevation are more likely to be infertile?
	- Limited evidence does suggest that women with female factor infertility are more likely to have TPO antibody positive compared to age-matched women who are not infertile.


- Q. What are the potential mechanisms linking Anti TPO positivity and infertility?
	- T cell abnormality
	- Hyperactivity and elevated mass of natural killer cells
	- Polyclonal B cell activation and non-organ-specific autoantibodies
	- Cross-reactivity
	- Vitamin D deficiency
	- Concurrent autoimmunity (i.e., endometriosis)
	- ![][image-3]


- Q. Should all women with infertility undergo thyroid function testing?
	- Yes.


- Q. Is LT4 treatment recommended in women with subclinical hypothyroidism with anti-TPO negative who have infertility but not planned for ART?
	- There is insufficient evidence for or against using LT4 in this group of patients.


- Q. A woman is to undergo ART and have subclinical hypothyroidism with a TSH of 6.0 mU/l. Would you treat this woman?
	- Yes
	- The guidelines suggest that subclinical hypothyroidism in women who are to undergo ART should be treated.
	- The target for TSH is \<2.5.


# - Clinicalpearl
	- Subclinical hypothyroidism (with an anti-TPO negative), with infertility:
		- Those not undergoing ART- insufficient evidence for or against to treat.
		- Those undergoing ART- treat and keep TSH \<2.5 mU/l (Strong recommendation)


- Q. What about anti-TPO-positive women with euthyroidism undergoing ART?
	- The guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to suggest for or against treatment in such a scenario; however, the benefits compared to harm are less, so giving a small dose of LT4 in a dose of 25-50 mcg/day may not be harmful.


# - Clinicalpearl
	- Subclinical hypothyroidism and ART:
		- Subclinical hypothyroidism and ART with or without anti-TPO positive – treat (strong recommendation)
		- Euthyroidism with Anti TPO positive undergoing ART –consider treatment with LT4 25-50 mcg to improve ART outcomes (Weak recommendation)


- Q. Does ovulation induction (ovarian stimulation impact thyroid function test)?
	- Physiologically, it is prudent to understand that ovarian hyperstimulation or ovulation induction may impact thyroid function
	- HCG, which is used here, may act on TSH receptors and increase thyroid hormones, while estrogen, which is produced in excess, may increase TBG and reduce free thyroid hormone.
	- Hence the impact of this is opposing and challenging to judge, but it does affect thyroid function.


- Q. What are the recommendations as far ovulation induction is concerned?
	- If a thyroid function test is done, then it must be done either before or 2 weeks after ovulation induction, since drugs used here may interfere with thyroid function test
	- If a woman becomes pregnant with ovulation induction – then do a thyroid function and treat as per the guidelines.
	- If the woman does not become pregnant, repeat the test after 2-4 weeks when levels may normalize.
