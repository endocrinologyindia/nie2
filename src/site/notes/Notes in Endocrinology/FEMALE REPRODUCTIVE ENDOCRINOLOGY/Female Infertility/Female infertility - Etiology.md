- Q. What is the most common cause of infertility in females?
    - Ovulatory dysfunction

- Q. Enlist some common causes of female infertility?
    - Ovulatory dysfunction
    - Pelvic adhesion
    - Endometriosis
    - Hyperprolactinemia
    - Tubal blockage
    - Other tubal abnormalities
    - Ovarian disorders

- Q. Which females are less likely to have ovulatory dysfunction?
    - Females having regular menses and molimina

- Q. Enlist the causes of ovulatory dysfunction?
    - Primary hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction
        - Immaturity at onset of menarche or perimenopausal decline
        - Intense exercise
        - Eating disorders
        - Stress
        - Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
        - Hyperprolactinemia
        - Lactational amenorrhea
        - Pituitary adenoma or other pituitary tumors
        - Kallmann's syndrome
        - Tumors, trauma, or radiation of the hypothalamic or pituitary area
        - Sheehan's syndrome
        - Empty sella syndrome
        - Lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune diseases)
    - Other disorders
        - Polycystic ovary syndrome
        - Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism
        - Hormone-producing tumors (adrenal, ovarian)
        - Chronic liver or renal disease
        - Cushing's disease
        - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
        - Premature ovarian failure, which may be autoimmune, genetic, surgical, idiopathic, or related to drugs or radiation
        - Turner syndrome
        - Androgen insensitivity syndrome
    - Medications
        - Estrogen-progestin contraceptives
        - Progestins
        - Antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs
        - Corticosteroids
        - Chemotherapeutic agents

- Q. What are the three WHO classes of anovulation?
    - Class I - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
    - Class II - Normogonadotropic normogonadism with anovulation (e.g., PCOS)
    - Class III - Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (e.g., Primary ovarian insufficiency)

- #Pearl
    - Oocyte aging is an important cause of ovulatory dysfunction in ovaries

- Q. Give the counts of ovarian follicles at various time points?
    - 6-7 million at midgestation
    - 1-2 million at birth
    - 300,000 at puberty

**Fallopian tube**

- Q. What is the primary cause of tubal infertility or tubal block?
    - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) - most common
    - Endometriosis - second most common

- Q. What is hydrosalpinx?
    - Patients with distal tubular obstruction develop hydrosalpinx proximally
    - This reduces the chances of fertility even by IVF

**Uterus**

- Q. Do uterine fibroids cause infertility?
    - Only submucosal or intracavity fibroids cause infertility
    - This is mainly due to inhibition of implantation

- Q. What uterine anatomical abnormalities lead to infertility?
    - Synechiae from previous uterine procedures
    - Müllerian abnormalities
    - Septate uterus

- Q. What is a Luteal phase defect? Does it cause infertility?
    - It is inadequate production of progesterone by corpus luteum
    - Progesterone is required to prepare the uterine endometrium for implantation
    - However, LPD causing infertility is questioned

**Other causes of infertility**

- Q. How does endometriosis produce infertility?
    - Formation of pelvic adhesions
    - Damage to the ovary by endometrioma
    - Production of growth factors and cytokines that impair fertility

- Q. Which cervical factors produce infertility?
    - Cervical trauma and anatomical abnormalities of the cervix

- Q. Do autoimmune disorders lead to infertility?
    - Autoimmune disorder per se may not lead to infertility but may be linked with a higher incidence of autoimmune oophoritis and POI
    - APS syndrome can lead to infertility and early pregnancy loss
    - Celiac disease has been linked with infertility

- Q. Do chromosomal abnormalities in women lead to infertility?
    - Yes
    - The chief being Turner syndrome

- Q. Which gene defect specifically affects follicular development?
    - TUBB8 mutation
    - It disrupts microtubular function and therefore arrests oocyte maturation during division

- Q. Summarize the causes of infertility in women?
    - Ovulatory dysfunction
        - Type I - hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
        - Type II - normogonadotropic normogonadism - PCOS
        - Type III - hypergonadotropic hypogonadism - POI
    - Fallopian tube and tubal block
    - Uterine factors
        - Anatomical defects
        - Fibroids
        - Endometriosis
    - Cervical factors
    - Autoimmune causes
    - Chromosomal and genetic factors
    - Lifestyle factors
    - Unexplained infertility
