**Assessment of ovulatory function**

- Q. What point in history generally rules out ovulatory dysfunction?
    - Most likely to be ovulatory:
        - Regular menses every 28 days
        - with molimina symptoms before menses

- Q. If the woman does not give the above history of normal ovulatory cycles, then what is done?
    - Do a mid-lueteal phase progesterone
    - It is done seven days before the expected date of menses (21st day of cycle)
    - If the level is >3 pg/ml- it suggests that ovulation has occurred

- Q. What are other tests for detection of ovulation?
    - Use of Home LH detection kit
    - Ultrasound assessment for ovulation
    - Endometrial biopsy

- Q. What is done if mid-lueteal progesterone is <3 pg/ml?
    - Assessment of ovulatory dysfunction is done
    - Baseline tests include PCOS work up – Ultrasound, testosterone, thyroid function, prolactin, 17 OHP

**Assessment of ovarian reserve**

- Q. Which patients should undergo ovarian reserve testing?
    - Age >35 years and not conceived for six months
    - Women with risk for POI- radiation exposure, chemotherapy, genetic abnormalities, autoimmune disease, etc

- Q. What is the difference between older women vs. younger women with poor ovarian reserve?
    - Younger women with poor ovarian reserve- have less quantity of ovaries but good quality
    - Older women- vice versa

- Q. What are tests done for assessment of ovarian reserve?
    - Day 3 FSH and estradiol
    - Antral follicular count on TVS
    - Clomiphene challenge test
    - AMH levels

**FSH, estradiol, and clomiphene challenge**

- Q. When we say day 3, what is day 1?
    - Day 1 is the first day of menstrual flow

- Q. What value of Day 3 FSH suggests normal ovarian reserve, and what suggests abnormal?
    - FSH <10 mIU/ml- normal
    - 10-20- borderline
    - more than 20 mIU/ml- poor ovarian reserve

- Q. What is the fundamental of day 3 FSH?
    - With good ovarian reserve, good amount of hormone production from small antral follicles → suppresses FSH

- Q. What does day three estradiol level suggest ovarian reserve?
    - Day 3 estradiol <80 pg/ml- good ovarian reserve
    - More than 80 pg/ml- poor reserve
    - Very important
        - ASRM says that estradiol interpretation is important mainly in women with normal FSH yet risk of poor ovarian reserve
    - When used alone, it is not very useful

- Q. What is the fundamental measurement of estradiol?
    - High estradiol means premature recruitment of ovarian follicle which occurs in women with poor ovarian reserve
    - Interestingly, this would suppress the FSH, and hence both FSH and estradiol measurements are required

- Q. Describe the clomiphene challenge test?
    - FSH and estradiol are measured on day 3 of the cycle
    - Clomiphene given for days 5 to 9 in a dose of 100 mg
    - FSH again measured on day 10

- Q. What is the interpretation of the clomiphene challenge test?
    - Again, day three and day 10 FSH <10 – normal
    - 10- 20 (some use 15) – inadequate
    - More than 20- poor
    - Estradiol – similar interpretation as earlier

- Q. What is the prognosis of women with poor ovarian reserve?
    - Generally poor prognosis
    - They can rarely conceive without the use of donor oocytes

**Antral follicle count**

- Q. What is the definition of antral follicles?
    - Measuring 2-10 mm in diameter

- Q. When is a measurement of antral follicle count done?
    - Generally, on days 2-4
    - However, studies have shown that it can be done at any phase of the cycle

- Q. How is AFC count done?
    - It is done by TVS
    - Ovary is assessed in both transverse and longitudinal planes
    - Diameter measured in 2 perpendicular planes and larger of the two dimensions is used for assessment

- Q. What AFC values suggest poor ovarian reserve?
    - Value <4-10 antral follicles on days 2-4 suggest poor ovarian reserve

**AMH**

- Q. Which follicles secrete AMH?
    - Preanteral follicle- <8 mm
    - Early antral follicles

- Q. What does AMH tell us?
    - AMH tells us the size of the primordial follicular pool
    - Hence it is a good biochemical marker of ovarian reserve

#Pearl
- AMH cutoffs vary according to labs; hence difficult to generalize

- Q. What is the interpretation of AMH?
    - <0.5 ng/ml- very poor ovarian reserve
    - <1 ng/ml - poor
    - 1.0 – 3.5 ng/ml – good ovarian reserve
    - More than 3.5 ng/ml- chance of ovarian hyperstimulation on ovulation induction
    - Newer assay uses cut point of 0.2-0.7 ng/ml

- Q. Does AMH need to be measured in the follicular phase?
    - No
    - It can be measured in any phase of the cycle since the growth of preantral follicles is continuous and not dependent on the phase of the cycle

- Q. Apart from AMH, which other similar test is used to judge ovarian reserve?
    - Inhibin B
    - Cutoff value is 40-45 pg/ml
    - However, it has poor sensitivity and specificity and is hence not used routinely

#Pearl
- The cut points of AMH depends on the assay used
- There is an older assay for AMH and a newer assay that have different cut points
- So, it is important to known which assay is used and what is its cut point for interpretation

**Assessment of fallopian tube patency and uterine anatomy**

- Q. Which is the first-line assessment of tubal patency?
    - HSG- hysterosalpingography

- Q. What is HyCoSy?
    - Hysteria-salphingo contrast sonography

- Q. What does HSG not tell you?
    - Does not tell you about adhesions and endometriosis
    - It also tells you more about distal tubal blocks – but does not tell you much about the proximal tubal blocks

- Q. What is the gold standard for tubal patency?
    - Laparoscopy with chromotubation

- Q. Which is another suitable non-invasive method for the tubal assessment?
    - Chlamydia trachomatis IgG antibody testing

- Q. What can be a cost-effective approach for tubal disorder?
    - First do chlamydia trachomatis IgG antibody
    - If negative- less likelihood of tubal disease
    - If positive- it can be falsely positive due to cross-reaction with C. pneumonia - hence to HSG
    - If the high risk of tubal disease- do HSG directly

- Q. Which is the test of choice for uterine cavity assessment?
    - Saline infusion sonohysterography
    - It is a special sonography
    - HSG can also assess the uterine abnormality
    - It is confirmed with further imaging like MRI or hysteroscopy

- Q. What is the role of hysteroscopy?
    - It is helpful for diagnosis and treatment of uterine abnormalities

- Q. What can hysteroscopy not tell you?
    - Status of the myometrium
    - Fallopian tube
    - Adnexal structures

#Pearl
- Fallopian and uterine assessment - HSG is a good test
- Uterine assessment alone (patient undergoing IVF)- saline infusion sonohysterography or Hysteroscopy

- Q. What is the role of laparoscopy?
    - It is done for the treatment of endometriosis and fallopian tube blocks
    - If it is done for any other reason- it must be combined with chromotubation to look for tubal patency

**Tests with limited clinical utility**

- Q. What is the role of endometrial biopsy?
    - To document secretory endometrium- which is a marker of ovulation has occurred
    - To correlate the endometrial timing with that of the IVF date – to assess Luteal phase defect
    - However, this test is rarely done for either indication these days

- Q. What is the fundamental of basal body temperature measurement?
    - Progesterone in the luteal phase affects the hypothalamus and increases basal body temperature

- Q. Describe the process of basal body temperature measurement?
    - Women measures the temperature by keeping the thermometer beneath the tongue every day before getting out of the bed
    - During the luteal phase, the temperature increase by 0.5 F compared to the follicular phase
    - It begins to rise 1-2 days after LH surge and remains high for ten days
