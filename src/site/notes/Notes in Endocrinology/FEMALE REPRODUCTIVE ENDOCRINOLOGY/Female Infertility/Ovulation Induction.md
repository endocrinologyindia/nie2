- Q. What is THE clinical sign of anovulation?
    - Oligomenorrhea
    - Defined as Cycle>35 days and <6 months


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Women with menstrual cycles of 35-45 may have intermittent spontaneous ovulation
    - More than 45- unlikely to have ovulation


- Q. What are lab tests for ovulatory dysfunction?
    - Lack of increase of basal body temperature by 5 degrees F
    - Midleuteal progesterone <2 ng/ml
    - Absence of ovarian follicles on TVS
    - Lack of LH surge on urinary LH monitoring


- Q. What are the three WHO classes of anovulation?
    - Class I- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
    - Class II- Normogonodotropic normogonadism with anovulation (e.g., PCOS)
    - Class III- Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (e.g., Primary ovarian insufficiency)


- Q. Which are the four major causes of anovulation?
    - Hypothalamic amenorrhea
    - PCOS
    - Hyperprolactinemia
    - Primary ovarian insufficiency


- **Overview of approach **


- Q. Which hormone is a reliable indication of ovarian function?
    - Serum AMH (antimullerian hormone)


- Q. Which cells produce AMH?
    - Small pre-antral(<8 mm)
    - Or Early Antral follicles


- Q. What is the relation between AMH and IVF success?
    - Low AMH (<1ng/ml) - Less ovarian reserve- poor IVF success
    - Very high AMH- more risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome


- Q. What are the goals of ovulation induction?
    - Monofollicular development and singleton pregnancy
    - Minimize risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
    - Maximize chances of pregnancy


- Q. Which type of patients have the highest risk of ovarian hyperstimulation?
    - PCOS patients


- Q. Which are the treatment of choice of each of the common causes of anovulation?
    - Hypothalamic amenorrhea  weight gain → if fails Pulsatile GnRH or Gonadotropins
    - PCOS- Clomiphene or Letrozole (Off label)
    - POI – advice IVF with donor oocyte
    - Hyperprolactinemia- dopamine agonist


- Q. Give the first, second, and third-line approach for ovulation induction in women with PCOS?
    - first-line weight loss
    - Second line- Clomiphene /letrozole +/- metformin
    - Third line- gonadotropins, ovarian drilling
    - Fourth line- IVF


- **Ovulation Induction Agents**


- **Clomiphene citrate ** (CC)


- Q. What is Clomiphene physiological?
    - It is a type of SERM (Selective estrogen receptor modulator)
    - It has part estrogenic and part antiestrogenic effect
    - It binds to estrogen receptors and competes with natural estrogen for the same


- Q. Can other SERMS like tamoxifen or raloxifene be used for ovulation induction?
    - Yes
    - But they are less successful


- Q. How is Clomiphene given?
    - It is given in a dose of 50 mg for five days on days 3 to 7 of menstrual Cycle
    - It is mainly used in [[PCOS\|PCOS]] patients


- Q. How is dose titration of CC done?
    - If ovulation does not occur with 50 mg, then the dose is increased to 100 mg in the next Cycle  this is the maximum dose
    - If ovulation occurs- the same dose is continued for 4-6 cycles


- Q. CC is used for a maximum of what number of cycles?
    - CC should not be used for more than 6-12 cycles; ASRM recommends no more than 12 cycles


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Generally, failure to conceive after six cycles of CC must trigger additional testing, including Hysterosaphnigography


- Q. When is a couple counseled for intercourse after giving CC?
    - LH surge typically occurs 5-12 days after stopping CC
    - Hence couple is counseled to have intercourse every day starting five days after the last dose of medication


- Q. How is LH surged diagnosed?
    - It can be diagnosed using a urinary LH kit
    - Brands are
        - Ovuline LH kit
        - i-Know kit
        - Ovutest kit


- Q. When does ovulation take place after LH surge?
    - Ovulation occurs about 14-48 hours after LH generally
    - Couples are advised that maximum fertility is for two days after LH surge is detected by the kit


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Clomiphene- days 3 to 7 of menstrual Cycle
    - LH surge occurs 5-12 days after stopping CC- can be monitored with urinary LH kit
    - Ovulation occurs 14-48 hours after LH surge


- Q. When does the rise in basal body temperature take place?
    - Occurs 1-5 days after LH surge (generally 1-4 days after ovulation)


- Q. What value of mid-luteal progesterone suggests ovulation?
    - More than 3 ng/ml (ideally >10 mg/ml) suggest ovulation


- Q. Is regular TVS monitoring required while on CC?
    - Some guidelines recommend regular TVS monitoring and HCG injection when the Follicle matures
    - It can be done if cost is not an issue
    - However, it is not required in all cases
    - It can be done in 1st Cycle to look for hyper-response


- Q. When is HCG injection given during ovulation induction?
    - Generally, PCOS women have adequate LH, so per se, HCG may not be required
    - However, some women have inadequate LH surge
    - In such women, TVS is done, and a single dose of HCG 5000-10,000 units is given when TVS shows follicular size >18 mm (mature Follicle)


- Q. How much time after HCG injection does ovulation occur?
    - 36-48 hours later


- Q. What are the success and risk parameters for Clomiphene?
    - Successful ovulation- 85%
    - Pregnancy rate of 40%
    - Twin pregnancy – 8 %
    - Triplet- 0.3%
    - OHSS – 1%
    - Miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy – not increased


- Q. How can multiple pregnancies be prevented?
    - By doing a TVS monitoring
    - Three or more Follicles >15 mm- stop ovulation induction and prescribe barrier contraception


- Q. What are the parameters that predict success?
    - Less free Testosterone
    - Oligomenorrhea as opposed to amenorrhea
    - Lower BMI
    - Lower ovarian volume


- Q. What is the mechanism of action of Clomiphene?
    - It blocks the effect of Estrogen on ER in the pituitary
    - Hence cutting off the negative feedback
    - This increases the FSH  produces ovulation


- Q. How does Clominphine produce hyperstimulation?
    - Clomiphene downregulates the ER
    - Because of this, even when the Clomiphene is stopped  because less ER estrogen cannot suppress the FSH till ER receptors are regenerated
    - Hence this can lead to hyperstimulation


- Q. What are the components of Clomiphene?
    - Combination of
    - Zu- clomiphene – 38%
    - En clomiphene- 62% - more potent antiestrogenic effect- primary effect in Ovulation induction


- Q. Do congenital malformations occur with Clomiphene?
    - No


- Q. Will patients having low estrogen respond to Clomiphene?
    - No
    - Estrogen is required for Clomiphene (CC)  to act
    - Hence women with PCOS do well with CC


- Q. When is CC preferred, and when is Letrozole chosen?
    - PCOS with
    - BMI <30 – CC
    - BMI > 30 – letrozole


- Q. Can it be given to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism women?
    - Though chances of response are less, some people give a trial of Clomiphene in hypo hypo patients before going for gonadotropins


- Q. Is it recommended for women with [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)\|Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)]]?
    - No


- **Adverse effects of Clomiphene **


- Q. Name some common side effects of CC?
    - Hot flashes
    - Abdominal distention
    - Nausea


- Q. What is done if there are ovarian cysts present on ultrasound?
    - CC is stopped if ovarian cysts are present on USG
    - Can be restarted once ovarian cysts disappear


- Q. Do visual symptoms occur after CC?
    - They have been reported
    - Exact reasons are not known
    - Some think it is because of retinal toxicity though not proven


- Q. Does it produce a luteal phase defect?
    - CC may produce iatrogenic Luteal phase defect in some patients
    - Giving HCG injection for ovulation followed by Progesterone support may have to be used


- Q. What is its effect on the endometrium?
    - May cause thinning of the endometrium


- Q. Does it increase cancer risk?
    - No

- Q. In which cases would you advice against intercourse for a patient on CC ?
	- In the first cycle a preovulatory scan is generally performed (10 days after starting CC)
	- If the patient has more than 3 follicles are present, it is generally advised to avoid intercourse 


- **Metformin **


- Q. Can metformin cause ovulation?
    - It can reduce hyperinsulinemia
    - Whether it spontaneously causes ovulation  less likely
    - It is sometimes combined with Clomiphene, but results are mixed


- Q. Is metformin per se recommended for ovulation induction?
    - Endocrine Society is against its use for ovulation induction
    - It is only to be used for glucose intolerance in PCOS, according to the Endocrine society
    - Other societies are in favor of using metformin as an add on for ovulation induction 


- **Letrozole (aromatase inhibitor)  **


- Q. How does Letrozole cause ovulation?
    - Reduce conversion of TestosteroneTestosterone to estrogen  reduces estrogen feedback to pituitary → increases FSH →induces ovulation


- Q. How does Letrozole compare to Clomiphene?
    - A meta-analysis of 9 trials have shown Letrozole to show a superior live birth rate compared to Clomiphene


- Q. Which subgroup of patients particularly does well with Letrozole?
    - Obese PCOS patients
    - Many experts suggest Letrozole as a drug of choice in Obese PCOS patients


- Q. What Does aromatase convert androstenedione to ?
    - Androstenadione → estrone
    - Testosterone → estradiol


- Q. Why does Letrozole produce fewer multiple pregnancies than CC?
    - As discussed previously, CC  causes depletion of ER → hence even after stopping, FSH levels remain high
    - Letrozole does not deplete ER, and hence once its work is done, the rest of ovarian follicles degenerate, estrogen increases→ , FSH falls


- Q. Why is Letrozole potentially teratogenic?
    - Because it can disrupt aromatase in the fetus


- Q. Why is letrozole and not anastrozole used for Ovulation Induction?
    - Because Letrozole is more effect Anastazole 


- Q. How is Letrozole given?
    - It is given in a dose of 2.5 mg on day 3-7 of Cycle
    - If this dose does not work, increase the dose to 5 mg to 7.5 mg in the subsequent cycles


- Q. Enlist the differences between CC and Letrozole?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FLbEiPTYVso.png?alt=media&token=7351c50e-c2cb-43c6-a62f-b158434be2bd)


- Q. Is Letrozole better than CC as far as the live birth rate is concerned?
    - Yes – especially in the obese PCOS group
    - The non-obese group live birth rate is similar to CC


- Q. Do animal studies show teratogenicity?
    - Yes


- Q. What about human studies
    - Whatever studies were done in humans have not shown any more teratogenicity compared to CC


- **Dopamine agonist **


- Q. What is the indication for the use of Dopamine agonist in ovulation induction
    - It is helpful for ovulation induction in hyperprolactinemic women


- **PULSATILE GnRH **
- Q. What is the advantage of Pulsatile GnRH
    - It produces a controlled release of FSH and LH
    - Hence it shows a more negligible effect on Gonadotropin stimulation


- Q. In which patients are pulsatile GnRH preferred
    - In women with Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism


- Q. Can it be used in PCOS patients?
    - It can be used in PCOS patients
    - However, it seems less logical because PCOS patients often have increased LH production


- Q. Give the protocol for GnRH administration
    - It is injected using a pump
    - IV is preferred to subcutaneous
    - A pulse is given every 60-90 minThe dose is 2.5-5 mcg per pulse
    - It is continued till ovulation occurs
    - After, that GnRH is discontinued, and HCG is given for luteal support- it is given in the dose of 500 IU on days 7, 10, and 13 after ovulation


- Q. What is the success rate of Pulsatile GnRH?
    - 90% ovulation rate and 80% successful pregnancy


- Q. What are the brands of GnRH agonists
    - Factual
    - Lutrepulse
    - (Generic name is Gonadorelin)


- **Gonadotropin therapy **


- Q. What are the indications for gonadotropin therapy?
    - PCOS- when oral agents have a failure
    - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism women


- Q. What are the various preparations of FSH?
    - HMG- crude preparation having 1:1 FSH and LH
    - uFSH- refined FSH preparation
    - rFSH- recombinant FSH


- #Clinicalpearl
    - The HCG and HMG are typically given IM
    - However, it can be given subcutaneously also


- Q. Which of the above is better?
    - Studies have shown similar results
    - However, rFSH preparations have less ovarian hyperstimulation


- Q. What is used to trigger ovulation?
    - HCG is used to trigger ovulation
    - It is given in a dose of 5000- 10,000 IU


- Q. What are the protocols used in ovulation induction?
    - High dose protocol- use FSH in a dose of 150 units directly  higher risk of hyperstimulation
    - Low dose, Step-up protocol- start with a lower amount of FSH and gradually up titrate – less risk of hyperstimulation
    - Low dose, step down a protocol 


- Q. Describe the step-up protocol?
    - Start with FSH 37.5 to 50 units per day
    - Perform ultrasound monitoring and estrogen monitoring
    - If there is no progress after 14 days,  increase the dose by 37.5 units → dose is increased weekly by 37.5 to a maximum dose of 225 units/day
    - If the ovarian response is seen, then HCG is added to trigger ovulation


- Q. Describe the Step-down protocol?
    - Start with 150 units /day on 1st day of the menstrual Cycle
    - Monitor using TVS
    - If the dominant Follicle is >10 mm,  then reduce the dose to 112.5 units/day  x 3 days
    - Then reduce to 75 units/day after three days  → continue till HCG is given for trigger


- Q. How is monitoring done during this protocol?
    - Monitoring is done using TVS
    - Scans are done every 2-3 days during the late follicular phase


- Q. When is HCG given?
    - When there is sufficient maturation of a single follicle


- Q. What are the criteria for follicle maturity?
    - Follicle maturity is when Follicle diameter >18 mm and/or
    - Estrogen >200 pg/ml


- Q. When is induction protocol stopped to prevent hyperstimulation?
    - When three or more follicles are >15 mm – then stop the ovulation induction
    - Do not give HCG
    - Prescribe barrier contraceptive to prevent pregnancy


- Q. What is the advantage of Step up protocol over standard high dose?
    - Less ovulation hyperstimulation


- Q. What is the success rate of the step-up protocol?
    - 72%- ovulation induction
    - 45% - pregnancy rate


- Q. Which is the better Step Up or Step Down protocol?
    - Studies have shown mixed results
    - Step down protocol may be better as it is more physiological


- **Complications **


- Q. What is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome?
    - It is a life-threatening complication
    - There is massive ovarian enlargement, third space fluid loss, hypovolemia, and thromboembolic phenomenon


- Q. What is a surgical option for women who fail with all the above measures?
    - Use laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (ovarian drilling)


- Q. Is there an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in patients given pharmacological therapy for ovulation induction?
    - It was previously thought
    - But there is no convincing evidence for the same at present


- Q. Does it increase the risk of breast cancer?
    - No


- Q. Is there an increased risk of childhood deformities or teratogenicity?
    - At present little evidence for the same.
