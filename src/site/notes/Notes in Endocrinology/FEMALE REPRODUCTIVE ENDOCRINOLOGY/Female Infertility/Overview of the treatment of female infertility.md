    - Depends on WHO class of ovulatory dysfunction
    - Class I – hypo hypo- treat with gonadotropins
    - Class II- Normal normal- PCOS  treat with ovulation induction
    - Class III- hyper hypo- gonadotropins + IVF- -> if it fails donor oocytes
    - Hyperprolactinemia- cabergoline
    - Ovulation induction- see [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Female Infertility/Ovulation Induction\|Ovulation Induction]]


- Q. What is the first-line treatment for obese anovulatory women (BMI >27)?
    - Weight loss
    - 5-10% weight loss improves ovulation dramatically


- Q. What is done for women with low weight (<17 kg/m2) with hypothalamic amenorrhea?
    - Weight gain

- Q. Enlist the options for ovulation induction?
    - Weight loss
    - Clomiphene
    - Metformin
    - Letrozole
    - Gonadotropins
    - GnRH pulse therapy
    - Laparoscopic ovarian drilling
    - Tamoxifen


- **Tubal factor infertility and adhesions **


- Q. What are the options for women with bilateral tubal disorders?
    - Corrective surgery to reverse tubal blockage – preferred in younger women with milder disease and poor access to IVF – high risk of ectopic
    - IVF- preferred in older women, women with access to IVF, and severe disease


- Q. What is done for unilateral tubal block?
    - Controlled ovarian stimulation is done
    - Proximal disorder- better prognosis than distal disorder


- Q. tubal surgery is more effective for proximal obstructions or distal?
    - More useful for distal obstructions


- Q. What is done for proximal obstructions?
    - Hysteroscopic treatment may be done
    - Surgery is more complicated for proximal obstructions – prefer IVF


- #Pearl
    - Distal obstruction- surgery
    - Proximal obstruction – Hysteroscopy

    - Septate uterus
    - Other congenital anatomical abnormalities


- Q. What is done if the uterine abnormality cannot be corrected?
    - Surrogate mother

- Q. What is done for women with cervical factor infertility?
    - IUI (usually combined with ovulation induction)
    - If it fails IVF


- Q. What is done for unexplained infertility?
