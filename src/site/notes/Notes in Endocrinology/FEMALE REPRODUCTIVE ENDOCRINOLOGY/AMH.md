- Q. What are the stages for folliculogenesis in females ?
    - Primordial follicles --> early primary follies → primary follicles → secondary follicles → graffian follicles

- Q. Of the above, which of them produce [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/AMH\|AMH]] ?
    - Mainly the Primary follicles (Preantaral and small Antaral follicles)

- Q. When does the [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/AMH\|AMH]] production begin and when does it end ?
    - Begins at 36 weeks of life and ends at menopause


- Q. What happens due to mutation in AMH or AMHR2 gene in men ?
    - Absence of AMH or AMHR2 gene leads to persistent Mullerian duct syndrome ie normal men with Mullerian structures


- Q. What is the Half-life of AMH ?
    - Strangely this is not known and there is no consensus on the same


- Q. Are AMH receptors present outside the ovaries ?
    - Yes
    - They are present in multiple organs- the exact effect of the same is not known


- **Regulation of [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/AMH\|AMH]]**


- Q. What is the impact of [[FSH\|FSH]] on AMH ?
    - FSH directly stimulates AMH
    - But FSH also increases [[estrogen\|estrogen]] which suppresses AMH
    - Hence there is a bidirectional relationship
    - The presence of androgens in the system cuts off the positive impact of FSH on AMH

- Q. What is the impact of LH on AMH ?
    - LH does not impact AMH
    - But LH suppresses the expression of AMH receptor (AMHR2)
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FUPeJ-cciTt.jpg?alt=media&token=ea569f1a-e778-4202-9b50-7addb202c93c)


- Q. What is the impact of estrogen on AMH ?
    - Estrogen suppresses both the AMH and AMHR2 expression


- Q. What is the impact of insulin on AMH ?
    - Insulin up-regulates AMH mRNA


- Q. What is the impact of stress on AMH ?
    - Hardy found that stress downregulates the AMH 


- Q. What is the impact of AMH on folliculogenesis ?
    - Basically AMH prevents recruitment of primordial follicles and prevents FSH based development of these follicles
    - The idea is to prevent multiple follicles from developing simultaneously
    - It also prevents the early follicles from atresia so as to maintain a good pool of the same from further recruitment 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FgLaSX0wU67.jpg?alt=media&token=9ae84108-b1b0-4840-9e4e-573f64bf406a)

    - "In vivo and in vitro studies showed that AMH has an inhibitory effect on primordial follicle recruitment and it decreases the sensitivity of follicles for the FSH-dependent selection for dominance"


- Q. What is the impact of AMH on breast and uterus ?
    - AMH induces apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines
    - it has impact on the growth of uterine endometrium

## CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF AMH
- Also see: [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/PCOS/Diagnosis of PCOS\|Diagnosis of PCOS]]
- Q. Does lack of AMH or AMH receptor lead to any disease in women ?
    - Interestingly, no
    - hence AMH is more of a marker in women then a disease-causing protein


- Q. What happens to AMH levels in women with PCOS ?
    - The AMH is elevated


- Q. Is AMH elevated in daughters of women with PCOS ?
    - yes


- Q. Does Hyperandrogenism contribute to high AMH in women with PCOS ?
    - Yes
    - There is a positive correlation between hyperandrogenism and AMH levels


- Q. What is the relationship between LH and AMH in PCOS ?
    - In normal circumstances LH has little impact on AMH levels
    - But in women with PCOS it is shown that LH levels upregulate AMH expression
    - LH levels correlate with AMH levels in women with PCOS


- Q. In which type of tumors is AMH expression increased ?
    - [[Granulosa cell tumors\|Granulosa cell tumors]]
    - These are important tumors because they have high rate of malignancy and poor prognosis
    - AMH may also be involved in the pathogenesis of the same
    - It is useful for detected recurrence after surgery 
    - The AMH expression is size-dependent, larger tumors (>10cm) are AMH negative


- Q. What happens to AMH levels in [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Endometriosis\|Endometriosis]] ?
    - AMH levels are lower in [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Endometriosis\|Endometriosis]]


- Q. Does AMH needs to be measured during a particular time of the day or during a particular time of the cycle ?
    - AMH can be measured at any time of the day 
    - Can be measured during any part of the menstrual cycle


- Q. What are the changes in the AMH levels in women as per age ?
    - AMH levels start increasing at birth
    - Peak is at around 15 years
    - Remain stable up to 25 years
    - then start declining


- Q. What method is commonly used for assaying AMH levels ?
    - ELISA


- Q. Does the ELISA measure AMH alone ?
    - No 
    - It also measures AMH precursor
    - So basically what you get from the report is AMH which is active+ AMH precursor which is inactive


- Q. Can we measure the active AMH alone ?
    - Yes
    - if you pretreat the sample with Sodium dodecyl sulphate or deoxycholate


- Q. Is there a correlation between AMH and metabolic precursors ?
    - At present there is poor correlation
    - But it is thought that this is probably because of the inactive AMH precursor which muddies the picture
    -  If we could measure the active AMH there is correlation between that and metabolic parameters

#Updates 

-   Q. Does AMH reflect the chances of fertility ? 
    -   AMH is a marker of [[ovarian reserve\|ovarian reserve]] and not a marker of ferility
    -   A women with low AMH can still be fertile
    -   Basically AMH reflects the period of ferility- lower AMH means lower shorter reproductive duration ^[Cedars MI. Evaluation of Female Fertility—AMH and Ovarian Reserve Testing. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. 2022 Jun;107(6):1510-9.]
