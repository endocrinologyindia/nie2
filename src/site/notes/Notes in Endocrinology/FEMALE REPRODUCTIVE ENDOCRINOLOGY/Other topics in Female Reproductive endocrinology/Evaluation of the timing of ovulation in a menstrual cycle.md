- Q. What are the ways in which ovulation can be detected? 
    - To detect impending ovulation
        - Urinary LH detection kit or serum LH
        - Basal body temperature measurement
        - Ultrasound
        - Change in cervical mucus – spinbarkitt 
    - To detect ovulatory cycles 
        - Menstrual cycle period and regularity – 28-35 days with normal regulatory- more likely to be ovulatory
        - Molimina symptoms
        - Luteal phase progesterone
        - Detect CL and endometrium on ultrasound
        - Endometrial biopsy 


- Q. What length of cycles is generally ovulatory? 
    - Menstrual cycles between 25-35 days are generally ovulatory 
    - Both shorter and longer cycles suggest anovulation 


- Q. What are the clinical symptoms that suggest ovulation ?
  
    - Midcycle 
        - Cervical mucus becomes thin
        - Mittelschmerz (midcycle bleeding)
    - End of cycle – premenstrual (molimina symptoms)
        - 1 bloating
        - 2. Breast tenderness
        - 3. Fluid retention
        - 4. Mood changes
    - Presence of molimina symptoms suggest ovulation 


- Q. When does the rise in basal body temperature take place? 
    - Occurs 1-5 days after LH surge (generally 1-4 days after ovulation) 


- Q. What is the fundamental of basal body temperature measurement? 
    - Progesterone in the luteal phase affects the hypothalamus and increases basal body temperature 


- Q. Describe the process of basal body temperature measurement? 
    - Women measures the temperature by keeping the thermometer beneath the tongue every day before getting out of the bed
    - During the luteal phase, the temperature increase by 0.5 F compared to the follicular phase
    - It begins to rise 1-2 days after LH surge and remains high for ten days


- Q. If the woman does not give the above history of normal ovulatory cycles, then what is done? 
    - Do a mid-lueteal phase progesterone 
    - It is done seven days before the expected date of menses (21st day of cycle) 
    - If the level is >3 pg/ml- it suggests that ovulation has occurred ^[Wathen NC, Perry L, Lilford RJ, Chard T. Interpretation of single progesterone measurement in diagnosis of anovulation and defective luteal phase: observations on analysis of the normal range. Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1984 Jan 7;288(6410):7-9. DOI: 10.1136/bmj.288.6410.7. PMID: 6418326; PMCID: PMC1444184]


- Q. Is this test always done on the 21st day of the cycle?
    - No
    - It is done seven days before the expected menstrual period
    - For women with a cycle length of 28 days, it is done on the 21st day
    - With the cycle of the length of 30 days, it is done on the 23rd day and so on


- Q. What are the means of identifying the fertile period? 
    - Calendar method
    - Basal body temperature measurement
    - LH surge using urinary LH detection kit
    - Recording the change in cervical mucous 


- Q. How is the fertile period calculated? 
    - The Fertile period is calculated by subtracting 14 days from the total cycle length of the shortest and longest periods 
    - Couple is counseled for intercourse at least every other day during the fertile period 
    - For example, if a person has a cycle length of 30 to 35 days – fertile days would be days 16 to 21 of the menstrual cycle (30-14 and 35-14) 
    - LH surge occurs five days before ovulation 


- Q. What is the time difference between LH surge in serum and urine? 
    - LH surge in blood precedes urinary LH surge by 12 hours 
    - This can be detected using home LH detection kits 


- Q. When does ovulation take place after LH surge? 
    - Ovulation occurs about 14-48 hours after LH generally
    - Couples are advised that maximum fertility is for two days after LH surge is detected by the Kit 


- Q. How can ultrasound help in the diagnosis of ovulation? 
    - It is most helpful if used serially
    - Both TAS and TVS can be used. TVS is preferred
    - Ovulation can be predicted by seeing a large preovulatory follicle of 20-25 mm in size before rupture 


- Q. How does the ultrasound appearance of endometrium suggest the phase of menses? 
    - Follicular phase- the ultrasound shows thick proliferative endometrium
    - Luteal phase shows- bright echogenic endometrium
