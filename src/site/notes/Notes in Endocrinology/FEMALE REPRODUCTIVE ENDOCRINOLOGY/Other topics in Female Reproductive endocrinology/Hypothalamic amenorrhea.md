- Also Called Functional Hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA)


- Q. What is the primary defect in this condition?
    - Inactivation of GnRH pulse generator


- Q. Is eating disorder more commonly associated with Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea?
    - Yes


- **Diagnosis and evaluation **


- Q. FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes have been ruled out, True or false?
    - True


- Q. Which are the four most common causes of [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Secondary amenorrhea\|Secondary amenorrhea]]?
    - Pregnancy
    - PCOS
    - FHA
    - Hyperprolactinemia


- Q. Which are the three important etiological causes of FHA?
    - Vigorous Exercise
    - Weight loss
    - Stress


- Q. What is the minimum amount of energy intake for menstrual functions to continue?
    - At least 30 kcal/kg/day is required for normal menstrual function
    - Below this- it leads to FHA
    - This would be around 1500 Kcal/day for a 50 Kg women


- Q. Do all women with FHA have amenorrhea?
    - No
    - There is a spectrum of disorder
    - Starting from Ovulatory eumenorrhea  to subtle defects like luteal phase defect etc. to amenorrhea


- Q. Are mood disorders associated with FHA?
    - Yes


- Q. In which women should evaluation for FHA be carried out?
    - Those having menstrual cycles > 45 days or
    - Amenorrhea for >3 months (this was six months earlier)
    - After one-year post menarche


- Q. What are the two leading theories that explain how energy imbalances cause FHA?
    - 1. Metabolic fuel hypothesis
        - Less availability of fuel is detected by peripheral system  cues to a central system to shutdown non-critical functions
    - 2. Critical body fat hypothesis
        - Certain minimal amount of body fat is required to maintain reproductive functions


- Q. What is the female athlete triad?
    - Reduce energy availability
    - Menstrual dysfunction
    - Low bone mass


- Q. What are the critical points in history to be included while dealing with a Case of FHA?
    - Exercise
    - Diet
    - Body image perceptions
    - Substance abuse
    - Eating disorder
    - Ambitions
    - High need for social approval
    - Sleep pattern
    - Stress
    - Menstrual pattern
    - Fracture
    - Rule out Pituitary causes from history


- Q. Which drugs can lead to amenorrhea?
    - Antipyschotics  reduce dopamine --> increase prolactin --> amenorrhea
    - OC pills continuously
    - Progestins
    - IUD
    - GnRH analog


- Q. What are the things to see in local gynecological examination in such a patient?
    - Red vagina- non estrogenized vagina
    - Bluish bulge- imperforate hymen


- Q. What is the first test done in women presenting with amenorrhea?
    - Beta HCG pregnancy test


- Q. What other investigations are done in a workup of FHA?
    - Beta HCG- pregnancy test
    - FSH / LH
    - Estradiol
    - Prolactin
    - Thyroid function
    - If features of hyperandrogenism–appropriate biochemical tests 


- Q. What is the typical hormonal pattern seen in FHA?
    - Low LH
    - Normal FSH (higher than LH)
    - Estradiol < 50 pg/ml
    - Progesterone <1 pg/ml
    - TFT- Low T3, low normal T4, and [[TSH\|TSH]] (Non-thyroidal illness type picture)


- Q. What do high FSH and LH with low estradiol suggest?
    - Impending [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)\|Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)]]


- Q. What does very low FSH and LH and estradiol suggest?
    - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism


- Q. When is MRI done in the case of FHA?
    - Headache
    - Clinical / lab evidence of other anterior pituitary hormone dysfunction
    - Vomiting
    - Change in vision
    - Lateralizing neurological signs


- Q. When is BMD-DEXA performed?
    - DEXA must be performed in women having six or more months of amenorrhea
    - It may be done earlier if there is bone fragility or other nutritional deficiency


- Q. What is defective in women with FHA / eating disorder- the BMD or bone microarchitecture?
    - Both are defective
    - Pearl
    - Young women with an eating disorder have a seven-fold increased risk of fracture


- Q. What are the changes in bone turnover seen in adolescents and older women with Anorexia nervosa?
    - Adolescents- have low bone turnover
    - Older women – have uncoupling of the bone turnover- reduced formation and increased resorption


- Q. Why is bone loss more in women with FHA and AN compared to other women with POI or oophorectomy?
    - This is because bone loss is not due to estrogen alone. It is a combination of factors that include
        - High cortisol
        - Reduced T3/T4
        - Low E2
        - Nutrition


- Q. What is the role of the progesterone challenge test in these women?
    - After ruling out progesterone challenge test is done in these women
    - Typical Medroxyprogesterone is given in a dose of 10 mg for ten days (5-10 mg for 5-10 days)
    - Other progesterone may also be used


- Q. What does absent bleed after progesterone challenge suggest?
    - outflow tract obstruction
    - Low endometrial estrogen exposure


- **Treatment of Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea**


- Q. Which patients with FHA require indoor admission?
    - Those with
    - Bradycardia
    - Orthostasis
    - Hypotension
    - Electrolyte imbalance


- Q. What is the critical aspect of managing FHA?
    - Improving energy balance
    - Increase of caloric intake and reduction of exercise


- Q. How much weight gain is required for the resumption of menses?
    - At least 2 kg above the weight which caused loss of menses


- Q. How much time would it take to resume menses after weight gain?
    - About 6-12 months


- Q. Can FHA and PCOS coexist?
    - Yes


- Q., which psychological technique is helpful in women with FHA?
    - Cognitive-behavioral therapy


- Q. Should OC pills be used in FHA women for resumption of menses and protection of bone?
    - The guidelines are against the use of OC pills in FHA


- Q. Do OCP have a protective effect on the bone?
    - No
    - They do not protect the bone based on the available evidence
    - This is based on the meta-analysis done by the Endocrine society


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Remember, bone loss in FHA is not due to estrogen-deficient alone, and there are other players like cortisol
    - Hence OCP is not a solution for the bone in women with FHA


- Q. OCP is not used, but how about the use of Estrogen and progesterone separately?
    - The guidelines suggest the use of estrogen and cyclic progesterone in adolescents who do not have a resumption of menses 6-12 months after regaining the weight
    - Transdermal estrogen is better in this regard


- Q. Does transdermal estrogen protect the bone?
    - Yes 
    - However, the estrogen will have a more negligible effect if nutritional factors are not corrected


- Q. So why does transdermal estrogen protect the bone while OC pills do not?
    - OC pills tend to reduce IGF1 in the bone, while transdermal estrogen does not
    - Have OC pills may have no benefit/detrimental effect on the bones


- Q. Should osteoporosis drugs like bone resorptive agents be used in women with FHA having low BMD?
    - Guidelines are against the use of osteoporosis medication in this setting


- Q. Why are they not recommending the use of bone resorptive agents?
    - There are no studies that have shown the benefit of the use of Bisphosphonates in FHA women
    - Whatever studies are available- are mainly known for Anorexia nervosa, which has shown some benefit
    - Remember these are young women with potential for pregnancy in the near future- bisphosphonates may have potential teratogenicity


- Q. What does the guideline say on the use of Recombinant leptin (metreleptin in these women )?
    - Preliminary studies have shown metreleptin showing a positive effect on LH pulsatility and endocrine effects
    - However, interestingly, as expected, leptin reduces appetite and causes further weight loss !!


- Q. What about the effect of leptin on the bone?
    - Studies have shown a positive effect of leptin on bone
    - However, more evidence is needed


- Q. Can teriparatide be used in these cases?
    - The guidelines recommend the use of teriparatide in FHA women with poor fracture healing and very low BMD for a short period


- Q. How will you manage an FHA patient with infertility?
    - Pulsatile GnRH is the first-line therapy. Gonadotropins may be used if GnRH is not available
    - Clomiphene may be used if estradiol levels are fine


- Q. What care must be taken before ovulation induction in these women?
    - The BMI Should be at least >18.5 kg/m2 before ovulation induction- else increased risk of pregnancy complications


- Q. What is the cardiovascular risk status in women with FHA?
    - They have a higher CV Risk than normal women
    - They tend to have dyslipidemia
    - Also, women with Anorexia nervosa rehabilitated have higher visceral fat probably due to lack of estrogen
    - Also, stress contributes to increasing CV risk
