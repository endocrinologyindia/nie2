- Q. Which is the best USG method for the evaluation of menstrual cycles? 
    - Transvaginal sonography (TVS)


- Q. What are the things to look for in TVS? 
    - Ovarian volume
    - Size and number of ovarian follicles
    - Corpus leuteum in luteal phase
    - Endometrium 


- Q. Is full bladder required for TVS? 
    - No
    - It is required for a transabdominal ultrasound 
    - Ovarian changes 


- Q. How is ovarian volume calculated? 
    - 0.523 x length x thickness x width 


- Q. What is the mean ovarian volume in adult women? 
    - 4.9 ml – premenopause
    - 2.2 ml- post menopause 


- Q. What is the Upper limit of normal for ovarian volume (2 SD above normal)? 
    - 20 ml for premenopause
    - 10 ml for post menopause 


- Q. Describe the ovarian follicles? 
    - Follicles as small as 2 mm can be detected on ultrasound
    - They are echo-free structures compared to surrounding stroma which is echogenic
    - They are spherical in diameter  


- Q. How do the follicles look at various phases of the menstrual cycle? 
    - Late luteal phase – folliculogenesis starts
    - Day 5-7 – number of follicles of 2-6 mm are visible
    - Day 8 onwards- dominant follicles of 10 mm and increasing is visible – it grows 2 mm a day 
    - Close to ovulation- dominant follicle generally 20-26 mm in size (size may be variable) 


- Q. How is ovulation predicted on USG? 
    - Size of dominant follicle- generally 20-26 mm in size
    - Presence of cumulus oophrous – triangular shaped
    - Granulosa separates from thecal layer- gives it a crenated appearance 
    - Preovulatory pain with dominant follicle on the same side – predicts ovulation 
    - Dilated cervical canal with cervical mucus appearing as a stripe 
    - Endometrium about 8-12 mm in size 


- Q. What happens after ovulation? 
    - Immediately after ovulation- corpus hemorraghicum
    - Later- Corpus luteum 


- Q. Can the function of CL be evaluated based on TVS? 
    - Vascularity and Size of CL correlates with progesterone levels (which is the function of the corpus luteum)


- Q. Which other finding can be seen after ovulation? 
    - Fluid in the pouch of Douglas 
    - Endometrial changes 


- Q. Describe the endometrial changes in the follicular phase? 
    - Early follicular phase- a single stripe of endometrium seen
    - Mid follicular- basal level enlarges- ‘triple stripe’ pattern
    - Late follicular- 8-12 mm endometrium


- Q. What are the changes in the Luteal phase? 
    - The triple stripe is replaced by a single thick hyperechoic stripe – measures 10-14 mm in size 
    - Wave like contraction may be seen in Endometrium 


- Q. Does the endometrial thickness predict the outcome of pregnancy? 
    - No 
    - Doppler studies 


- Q. What are the changes in uterine blood flow during menses? 
    - High uterine vascular resistance – seen in the follicular phase
    - Reduces close to the ovary
    - Nadir after ovulation and remains low
    - Starts increasing in the late luteal phase again 


- Q. What happens to the ovarian blood flow? 
    - In the initial phase of the follicular cycle- ovarian blood flow is less- high resistance
    - Resistance starts reducing, and blood flow improves as dominant follicle starts to develop and angiogenesis occurs
