    - Confirmation of the disorder
        - F) Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 symptomatic cycles (although a provisional diagnosis may be made prior to this confirmation). Exclude other Medical Explanations
        - G) The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drug abuse, medication, or other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).


- Q. Is there a genetic component of  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?
    - Yes, it is believed to be due to the involvement of the ESR1 gene - estrogen receptor alpha 1 gene


- Q. Biologically, what is the reason for PMS?
    - It occurs in the Luteal phase of the menstrual cycle
    - Earlier, it was believed to occur due to changes in the  estrogen and progesterone
    - However, it is now believed to occur because of changes in the neurotransmitter response (especially serotonin) in response to the hormones
    - Hence  SSRI  tend to be the most effective therapy for PMS 


- Q. Treatment with which vitamin is helpful in the management of PMS?
    - Vitamin B6


- **Clinical Features and diagnosis**


- Q. Which are the typical behavioral or psychological symptoms of PMS?
    - Mood swings and irritability are the most common behavioral symptom of PMS
    - Others include
        - anxiety/tension

        - hot flashes
        - dizziness


- Q. Are hot flashes also seen?
    - Yes.
    - PMS is the most common cause of hot flashes outside of Perimenopausal syndrome
    - Hence this must be included in the differential diagnosis of Hot flashes 


- Q. Which endocrine disorder must be ruled out in patients with PMS?
    - Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism need to be ruled out


- Q. How will you differentiate PMS from other mood disorders?
    - General mood disorder will occur irrespective of the menstrual cycle phase
    - PMS tends to occur mainly in the luteal phase
    - However, some mood disorders tend to worsen in the premenstrual/luteal period, and hence sometimes differentiation is difficult


- Q. At what age do these symptoms develop?
    - The symptoms of PMS can start right at the time of menarche and continue throughout the reproductive period, often ending during menopause
    - They are also more likely to have symptoms during the menopause transition
    - The symptoms may resolve during pregnancy as well. 


- Q. Is there any laboratory test for establishing the diagnosis of PMS?
    - No
    - However, a thyroid function test must be done to rule out thyroid dysfunction


- Q. Are the menstrual cycles regular in women with PMS?
    - They are generally normal
    - However, they are more likely to experience irregular menses during the menopause transition period 


- Q. What is the relation between OCP and PMS?
    - OCPs are sometimes used to treat PMS. However, they are not the first-line therapy
    - OCP can induce PMS like symptoms in some women


- Q. What questionnaire is used for diagnosis and monitoring of PMS?
    - Daily record of severity problem (DRSP) form 
    - {{pdf: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FC5eXKgIWhe.pdf?alt=media&token=dcb7c24a-b008-4fe0-bb3f-27a96caa0654}}


- Q. How is the DRSP used to make the diagnosis of PMS?
    - Record the score for each item 1 on each day using the following scale of 1 to 6: 1 = not at all, 2 = minimal, 3 = mild, 4 = moderate, 5 = severe, 6 = extreme.
    - Add the scores in the column for the first day of menses. If the total score is less than 50, consider a diagnosis other than premenstrual syndrome. 
    - If the total score is greater than 50, record two cycles of symptoms. 
    - If more than three items have an average score of more than 3 (mild) during the luteal phase, add the scores of five-day intervals during the luteal and follicular phases. 
    - A luteal phase score that is 30 percent greater than the follicular phase score indicates a diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome.


- Q. Enlist the differential diagnosis of PMS?
    - 1. Underlying mood disorder
    - 2. Hypothyroidism
    - 3. Hyperthyroidism
    - 4. Menopausal transition
