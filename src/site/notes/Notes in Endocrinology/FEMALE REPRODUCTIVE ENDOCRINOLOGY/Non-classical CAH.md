    - Please note- the values are in ng/ml - to convert to ng/dl multiply the values by 100


- Q. What value is diagnostic in children  ?
- Uptodate says:
    - < 0.82 ng/ml (82 ng/dl) - rules out Non-classical CAH in children
    - More than 2 ng/ml (200ng/dl)s surely NCCAH and ACTH stimulation is generally not needed 
    - 0.82-2 ng/ml (82-200 ng/dl) â€“ may consider doing a ACTH stimulation 


- Q. What is the diagnostic value in an adolescent ?
    - A baseline 17 OHP >15 ng/ml is diagnostic of non-classical CAH


- Q. At what time after giving ACTH is sample repeated ? 
    - 60 min 


- Q. Describe the management of NCCAH in children ? 
    - In children with hyperandrogenism and bone age advancement  -Start hydrocortisone 10-15 mg/m2

    - They have not been clearly defined 
    - 17-OHP should be in upper limit of normal
