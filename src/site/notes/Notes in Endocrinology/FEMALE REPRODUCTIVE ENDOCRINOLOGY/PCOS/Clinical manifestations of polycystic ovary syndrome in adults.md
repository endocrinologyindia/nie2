- Q. When does the menstrual irregularity of PCOS begin? 
    - At the time of menarche! 


- Q. What is the characteristic gonadotropin dynamics in PCOS? 
    - GnRH pulse amplitude is altered, leading to the preferential release of LH in preference to FSH
    - Thus, LH is high, and FSH is relatively lower with a high LH/FSH ratio
    - This is not seen in all cases though
    - Prenatal androgen exposure may produce this risk – it is proposed 


- Q. Apart from classical oligo/amenorrhea, which other menstrual abnormalities are seen with PCOS? 
    - Dysfunctional uterine bleeding- heavy menstrual bleeds, frequent menstrual bleeds
    - Polymenorrhea 
    - Menorrhagia 
    - Intermittent breakthrough bleeding 


- Q. Why are women with PCOS at increased risk of Endometrial carcinoma? 
    - Anovulation  unopposed estrogen action on endometrium → little or no progesterone / luteal phase 
    - Hyperinsulinemia → increases IGF1 activation
    - Obesity itself is a risk factor
    - Hyperandrogenemia is a risk factor 


- Q. How to monitor for Endometrial risk using TVS? 
    - On TVS, endometrial thickness <7 mm – rules out endometrial hyperplasia /carcinoma 


- Q. What are the typical ovarian histological changes in PCOS? 
    - Increase the number of preantral and small antral follicles arranged in the periphery
    - Increase stroma
    - thick and sclerotic cortex 


- Q. What is the USG appearance of PCOS? 
    - Increase ovarian volume > 10 ml
    - Increase the number of small follicles of 2-9 mm (Rotterdam- 12 , AES- 25 using high-frequency probe)
    - Number of follicles and ovarian size reduce with age, and hence for women >40  - age-specific criteria must be used 


- Q. What are changes in the follicular fluid? 
    - Fluid has more androgen and less estrogen


- Q. What happens to follicular development in PCOS? 
    - Initial development is fine- in fact exaggerated
    - Later development  -follicular arrest
    - Development till secondary – early tertiary follicle is fine- further development is arrested
    - Typical grow till 5-8 mm in size 


- Q. What is the problem in women with PCOS with regards to pregnancy? 
    - Increase the risk of anovulatory infertility
    - Increase abortion risk in pregnancy
    - Increase the risk of GDM
    - Preeclampsia
    - Preterm delivery
    - Neonatal ICU admission


- Q. What are the reason for increase pregnancy-related complications? 
    - Increase low-grade inflammation
    - Associated obesity 


- Q. What happens to the menstrual cycle of PCOS women as they age? 
    - Menstrual cycles tend to become more regular as they age! 
    - The age of menopause, however is not changed 
    - The hyperandrogenism may persist  after menopause 
    - Hyperandrogenism 


- Q. What percentage of women with PCOS have increased androgen levels? 
    - 50-90% 


- Q. What percentage of PCOS women are obese? 
    - 50% 


- Q. How does hyperinsulinemia produce hyperandrogenism in PCOS? 
    - Increase activation of ovarian theca cells to produce androgens
    - Reduces SHBG  increase of free testosterone 


- Q. Do women with PCOS have an increased risk of NASH? 
    - Yes
    - 30% of women with PCOS have ALT elevation
    - This is even more than diabetes! 


- Q. what percentage of women with PCOS fulfill Metabolic syndrome criteria? 
    - 43% 


- Q. Do women with PCOS have an increased risk of diabetes? 
    - Yes, type 2 diabetes 


- Q. Which molecular defect in PCOS links PCOS with diabetes? 
    - There is a defect in serine phosphorylation
    - Abnormal serine phosphorylation in Insulin receptor  increase hyperinsulinemia
    - Abnormal serine phosphorylation in 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17)  increase ovarian androgen production 


- Q. Do women with PCOS have increased OSA? 
    - Yes
    - They should be questioned about OSA 


- Q. What are the lipid abnormalities in PCOS? 
    - Increase TG
    - Reduce HDL
    - Increase LDL
    - Typical of metabolic syndrome 


- Q. Do they have to increase CV risk? 
    - Increased CV risk has not been documented yet 

- Q. We know OCP causes increased VTE risk. Is PCOS itself associated with an increased risk of VTE? 
    - This is not proven 


- Q. What are the psychosocial manifestations of PCOS ? 
    - More associated with :
    - Mood disorders- depression and anxiety
    - Eating disorder- binge eating 


- Q. Summarize the clinical manifestations of PCOS? 
    - 1. Reproductive abnormalities
        - Oligo/amenorrhea
        - DUB
        - Intermittent Breakthrough bleeds
        - Increase the risk of endometrial carcinoma
        - Ovulatory infertility
        - Pregnancy complications 
    - 2. Hyperandrogenism
        - Hirsutism
        - Female pattern hair loss
        - Acne
        - Virilization- rare 
    - 3. Metabolic abnormalities
        - Hyperinsulinemia
        - OSA
        - NASH
        - Metabolic syndrome
        - Dyslipidemia
        - IGT/type 2 diabetes
    - 4. Other
        - Increase mood disorder
