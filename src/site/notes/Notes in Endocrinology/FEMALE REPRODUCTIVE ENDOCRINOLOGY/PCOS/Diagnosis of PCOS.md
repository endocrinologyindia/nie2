- **Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults**


- Q. Give the diagnostic criteria for PCOS? 
    - Rotterdam Criteria (two out of three required)
        - Oligo or anovulation
        - Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism
        - Polycystic ovaries (by ultrasound)
    - AES definition 2008 (all required)
        - Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism
        - Ovarian dysfunction
            - oligo-anovulation
            - and/or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound
        - Exclusion of others:
            - androgen excess or
            - ovulatory disorders


- Q. What is the significant difference between NIH and AES criteria? 
    - NIH – does not ask for USG for the establishment of anovulation
    - AES – asks for clinical / USG criteria for anovulation 


- Q. When to measure DHEAS in a case which looks like PCOS clinically? 
    - Only when signs of virilization are present 


- Q. Rotterderm USG criteria, requires one ovary or both ovaries to show typical morphology? 
    - One ovary showing characteristic morphology is enough 


- Q. When to use a cut-off of 12 follicles and when to use 25 follicles cut-off in Rotterdam criteria? 
    - If TVS done with probe < 8 Hz – use 12 follicles
    - If TVS done with probe > 8 Hz- use 25 follicle criteria 


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Remember Rotterdam criteria is based on TVS and not TAS


- Q. Which tests are done to rule out other causes of oligomenorrhea? 
    - Prolactin – hyperprolactinemia
    - TSH – hypothyroidism
    - FSH- high FSH suggest POI
    - 17 OHP- Non-classical CAH 
    - Measurement of LH is not required 


- **Additional tests once the diagnosis is established **


- Q. What additional test must be done once the diagnosis of PCOS is established? 
    - OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test)
    - Lipid profile
    - BP measurement 


- Q. Are tests for diagnosis of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR etc.) indicated? 
    - No 


- Q. Should women with PCOS be screened for anxiety and depression? 
    - Yes 
- Q. How to screen for depression? 
    - PHQ9 is ideal
    - PHQ2 – can be used for quick assessment 
- Q. What are the questions asked in PHQ2? 
    - During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
    - During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?
    - You can either score from 0 to 3 or ask yes or no
        - If single Yes- suggest depression
        - Or score >/= 3 / 6 suggest depression 


- Q. How is screening for anxiety disorder done? 
    - GAD-7 questionnaire 


- Q. Should you screen these women for OSA? 
    - Questions about symptoms of OSA
    - If present – refer to sleep medicine

    - 3. Question about symptoms of OSA 
    - 4. Fertility evaluation if pregnancy is planned 


- USE OF AMH FOR PCOS DIAGNOSIS and FOLLOW-UP


- Q. What is the basis of using AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS?
    - AMH is produced by the small antral follicles
    - They are the same ones that are seen on ultrasound in PCOS
    - Hence AMH can be used as a surrogate biochemical marker of PCOS


- Q. What is the biggest challenge in the use of AMH for PCOS diagnosis?
    - The AMH assay is not standardized


- Q. Which cells in the ovary produce AMH?
    - They are produced by granulosa cells of ovaries


- Q. Which follicles produce AMH?
    - There expression starts right from the primordial follicle
    - Highest levels are seen in the preantral follicle and small-antral follicles
    - The Primordial, primary, secondary and small tertiary (grafiaan follicles) produce AMH


- Q. What is the role of AMH in these follicles?
    - AMH in these early follicles discourages its further development and prevent it from developing into a dominant follicle in future


#Clinicalpearl
    - AMH has an inhibitory role on primordial follicle recruitment and its development
	
	
- Q. How does the AMH induce this inhibitory effect?
    - It reduces the sensitivity of the ovarian follicles to FSH


- Q. What is the AMH assay method?
    - It is assayed with ELISA


- Q. What is the problem with the assay?
    - There is a lack of standardization, and hence no value is agreed upon
    - Hence value will differ from lab to lab
    - Recently, there has been automatization of the process, and hence there is hope that there will be uniformity


- **AMH as an indicator of ovarian reserve **


- Q. What is ovarian reserve?
    - It is defined as the number of remaining primordial follicles


- Q. How many primordial follicles are present at the time of puberty?
    - About 400,000


- Q. Is AMH a good marker of ovarian reserve?
    - Yes
    - Because it is produced by the follicles which are kept in reserve – the primordial follicle and the pre-antral follicles
    - Hence it is an excellent biochemical marker of ovarian reserve
    - It correlates well with antral follicular count on TVS


- Q. What size follicles are counted in AFC?
    - Follicles of size 2-9 mm are counted
    - They are precisely the ones that produce AMH
    - AMH may be better than AFC because it also includes the primordial follicles and pre-antral follicles, which are not counted in AFC


- Q. What are the controversies regarding AMH use as a marker of ovarian reserve?
    - Some say obesity can reduce AMH value physiologically
    - The effect of OC pills on AMH is not known
    - PCOS and AMH


- **Pathophysiology of PCOS from AMH perspective**


- Q. Which follicular cells are increased in PCOS?
    - Pre-antral and small antral cells
    - These cells are 2-4 times higher than in normal women
    - These cells specifically produce AMH


- Q. Is there a relation between androgens and AMH?
    - Yes
    - Increase androgens are associated with an increase of AMH values


- Q. What is the impact of FSH on AMH?
    - It has a dual-action
    - FSH increase AMH per se in pre-antral follicles which do not produce Estradiol
    - The follicles which have aromatase produce estradiol in the presence of FSH
    - Estradiol, on the other hand, suppresses AMH
    - So basically, FSH may increases AMH in pre-antral follicles, which suppresses AMH in later follicles


- Q. Is AMH part of the pathogenesis in PCOS?
    - It could very well be
    - AMH prevents the action of FSH on ovarian follicles
    - Hence if AMH is in excess,  it will block the development of ovarian follicles
    - This would lead to follicular arrest, which is classically seen in PCOS


- Q. What is the effect of LH on AMH?
    - LH enhances AMH production


- Q. But granulosa cells do not have LH receptors, so how does the LH enhance AMH?
    - In PCOS, the granulosa cell acquire LH receptor early


- **AMH in the diagnosis of PCOS **


- Q. Do all growing follicles contribute to the Serum AMH pool?
    - Tough earlier follicles produce AMH; they are not reflected in the serum because they are not vascularized
    - It is the secondary follicle onwards that are vascularized, which contribute to the serum AMH value


- Q. What cut-off of AMH value helps in the diagnosis of PCOS?
    - It is impossible to have one cut off because of AMH assay related issues
    - However, AMH cut-off of >4.9 ng/ml is an excellent diagnostic cut-off for PCOS with good sensitivity and specificity.
    - This cut-off is proposed by EIA kit for AMH by Beckman colter


- Q. Does the value of AMH correlate with the severity of PCOS symptoms?
    - Yes


- Q. Can AMH be used in adolescent PCOS diagnosis?
    - Yes
    - It may be a good test since the USG is not reliable in adolescents
    - However, cut off in adolescents are different – AMH is higher in adolescents


- **Use of AMH in the follow-up of the treatment of PCOS **


- Q. What is the potential use of AMH in PCOS and infertility?
    - Though cut-offs are not established, AMH can help decide the ovulation induction protocol for infertile PCOS while avoiding ovarian hyperstimulation


- Q. Does AMH help in predicting the efficacy of OC pill treatment in PCOS?
    - It may be helpful in this regard, but data is scarce
    - OC pills should reduce AMH values in PCOS


- Q. what about the efficiency of treatment in obese PCOS?
    - With weight loss –the AMH value normalizes in obese PCOS
    - Hence it may be helpful in this regard


- Q. What about metformin use?
    - Studies have shown a reduction of AMH with the use of metformin in PCOS patients


- Q. Summarize the use of AMH in PCOS?
    - Diagnosis of PCOS in adults
    - Diagnosis of PCOS in adolescence
    - Severity of PCOS symptoms
    - Selection of ovulation induction protocol
    - Evaluate the effect of treatment in PCOS


- **DIAGNOSIS OF PCOS IN ADOLESCENTS**


- Q. By what time after the start of menses do girls have regular menstrual cycles?
    - First 1-2 years cycles can be shorter or longer
    - By gynecological age 4-5 yrs the cycles become regular adult-type cycles between 21-35 days


- Q. What is the difference between early menstrual cycles in girls and adults?
    - Early menstrual cycles in girls are often anovulatory (but asymptomatic anovulatory)
    - They are what is called “Immature ovulatory cycles” with inadequate progesterone release in the later half of the cycle


- Q. When should you evaluate for ovulatory disorder in adolescence?
    - When the immature anovulatory cycle persists after 1-2 years- then they need to be evaluated


- Q. Uptil what young age can Ferriman Gallaway scored applied to?
    - Ideally, FG score is for women >18 years
    - However, we can go down up to 15 years of age
    - Adult degree of hirsutism can be applied within two years of menarche


- Q. What type of acne in adolescents should be considered abnormal?
    - Mild to moderate comedone acne is normal
    - Inflammatory acne should be considered abnormal, and it suggests hyperandrogenism


- Q. What testosterone levels should be considered for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents?
    - Adult testosterone levels are achieved in the peri menarche age
    - You can use adult reference ranges for perimenarche girls for testosterone values


- Q. Is ultrasound criteria a good idea for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents?
    - No
    - Lot of adolescents have morphology (1/3rd) of PCOS in ultrasound
    - Hence USG may not be a good idea for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents


- Q. What clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism should be considered for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents?
    - Inflammatory acne
    - Moderate to severe hirsutism


- Q. What are the criteria for biochemical hyperandrogenism in adolescent girls?
    - Persistently elevated androgen level from reliable reference lab is reliable evidence of hyperandrogenism in adolescents with PCOS
    - Single reading of higher testosterone should not be relied upon
    - Adult reference values may be used in the absence of age-specific reference ranges


- Q. What is clinical evidence of anovulation in adolescents with PCOS?
    - The following is abnormal :
        - Menstrual cycle <20 days or >45 days two years after the onset of menses
        - Menstrual cycle >90 days in first two years after menarche
        - No onset of menarche at age 15 years or 2-3 years after the onset of thelarche


- Q. What is the ultrasound criteria for PCOS in adolescents?
    - Ovarian volume >12 ml (in adults is 10ml) is evidence of PCOM (By trans-abdominal ultrasound)
    - Ovarian follicular count and other features are not reliable in adolescents with PCOS


- Q. Give the Summary of diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescents?
    - Diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents
        - Anovulation
        - Hyperandrogenism
        - Ovarian morphology on ultrasound
        - Ruling out other causes

        - Ultrasound
        - Ovarian volume >12 ml by TAS
    - Hyperandrogenism
        - 1. Clinically
