- Q. What is the prevalence of PCOS?
    - 6-10% of women in the reproductive age group have PCOS based on the original NIH criteria


- Q. Which patients are at high risk of having PCOS?
    - First degree relative with PCOS
    - Obesity
    - Type 1, type 2 diabetes, or GDM history
    - Signs of insulin resistance / metabolic syndrome
    - Premature adrenarche
    - Women on antiepileptic drugs (especially valproate)
    - Anovulatory infertility


- Q. Who first described PCOS?
    - Stein and Levinthal


- Q. What is the most common source of androgens in PCOS?
    - It is mainly ovarian hyperandrogenism


- **Pathogenesis **


- Q. Summarize the pathogenesis of PCOS with a picture?

- Q. Does PCOS have a heritable component?
    - Yes
    - Proven in Twin studies
    - The genetic component may be as high as 70% contributing to PCOS


- Q. What factors contribute to the genetic component of PCOS?
    - Difference in energy metabolism
    - Difference in gonadotropin secretion- LH predominance
    - Difference in secretion/action of insulin
    - Difference in androgen biosynthesis by the ovary


- Q. Which are the candidate genes for PCOS?
    - There are 100s of genes implicated
    - But two genes which have the strongest evidence-based on GWAS are
    - THADA gene
    - DENND1A


- Q. When does GnRH stimulate LH, and when does it stimulate FSH release?
    - More rapid GnRH pulse produces LH, and slower GnRH pulse produces FSH


- Q. What is the LH pulse frequency at various phases of the menstrual cycle?
    - Early follicular- 90 min
    - Late follicular (close of ovulation)- 60 min
    - Early luteal – 100 min
    - Late luteal – 200 min


- Q. What happens in PCOS in terms of GnRH pulse, and what is its consequence?
    - There is rapid GnRH release leading to predominant LH production in preference to FSH
    - Increase LH Theca cells have LH receptors so increase activation of Theca cell→ theca cells produce androgen so increase ovarian androgen production
    - Reduce FSH  granulosa cell have FSH receptor → reduced ovarian follicular development


- Q. Is this the only problem?
    - Not all women with PCOS have LH predominant response
    - Hence rapid LH pulsation is not the only reason for PCOS, and other things also have to be considered


- Q. Which drugs reduce insulin resistance?
    - Metformin
    - TZD
    - D-Chiro-Inositol


- Q. How does insulin contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS?
    - Reduces SHBG
    - Theca cells have insulin receptor-activated → androgen production


- Q. What percentage of women with PCOS have insulin resistance?
    - 50-70%


- Q. Which molecular defect in PCOS links PCOS with diabetes?
    - There is a defect in serine phosphorylation
    - Abnormal serine phosphorylation in Insulin receptor  increase hyperinsulinemia
    - Abnormal serine phosphorylation in 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17) → increase ovarian androgen production


- Q. What is the change in micro RNA seen in PCOS?
    - Increase of miR-93 RNA expression
    - This may contribute to the insulin resistance


- Q. Does weight gain contribute to PCOS or vice versa?
    - It could be either or both


- Q. What are some other factors implicated?
    - Role of Adrenal androgens
    - Role of Diet  androgenic content in the diet
    - Role of androgen exposure to the fetus during intrauterine life


- Q. Summarize the various factors involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS
    - Genetic component- DENND1A  and THADA
    - Role of GnRH pulsatility and LH predominance
    - Role of insulin resistance
    - Role of obesity
    - Role of other factors- adrenal androgen, diet, prenatal exposure to androgens


- **Steroid hormone metabolism in polycystic ovary syndrome**


- Q. What are the sources of various androgens in women?
    - DHEA/DHEAS- 100% from the Adrenal gland
    - Androstenedione- 50% from the ovary and 50% from adrenal
    - Testosterone- 25% - ovary, 25% adrenal, 50% from peripheral conversion of androstenadione


- Q. What is the difference in androgen source in normal premenopausal women vs. women with PCOS?
    - In normal premenopausal women, androstenedione and testosterone come 50,50% from the adrenal and ovary
    - In PCOS- they come mainly from ovaries instead of adrenals


- Q. Which product is an exclusive marker of peripheral androgen action?
    - Androstanediol
    - It is an indicator of androgen action on the skin and hence correlates well with hirsutism
    - It is derived from the metabolism of DHT


- Q. What happens to estrogen levels in PCOS women?
    - Estrogen, especially estradiol levels, are normal in women with PCOS
    - Estrone derived from androstenedione may be a little higher


- Q. Do statins reduce hyperandrogenemia by reducing the cholesterol substrate?
    - Yes
    - Statins can potentially reduce androgen levels in PCOS women by reducing the cholesterol available as substrate


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Remember Theca cells have LH receptors and produce androstenedione
    - Granulosa cells have FSH receptors and produce estrogen


- Q. What is the functional classification of PCOS based on the source of androgens?
    - Typical PCOS
        - Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism
        - Increase 17 OHP in response to GnRH analog (basically this is hyper-responsiveness to LH)
        - This is seen in 2/3rd of cases
    - Atypical PCOS
        - Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism with no increase of 17 OHP to GnRH
        - Functional adrenal hyperandrogenism
        - Hyperandrogenism from neither adrenal nor ovarian source


- Q. Which are the various tests done to find the source of androgen in PCOS?
    - GnRH agonsit test  - 17 OHP - >152 ng/dl – s/o of Funtional ovarian hyperandrogenism
    - HCG stimulation test- 17 OHP - >152 ng/dl – s/o of Funtional ovarian hyperandrogenism
    - Short dexamethasone suppression test- testosterone >26 ng/dl – suggestive of the ovarian source of androgen
    - ACTH stimulation test – DHEA – 1500 ug/dl – s/o of Functional adrenal hyperandrogenism
