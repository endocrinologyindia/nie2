    - Pregnancy
        - Hypothalamic causes – Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea 
    - Pituitary
        - Prolactinoma
        - NFPA/ other pituitary adenoma
        - Empty sella
        - Sheehan's syndrome
    - Ovarian
        - PCOS
        - POI
        - Ovarian tumors
    - Adrenal
        - Cushing’s syndrome 
        - Adrenal tumor
        - CAH
    - Uterine
        - Uterine adhesions- Asherman syndrome
    - Others 
        - hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism


- Q. What is the definition of secondary amenorrhea ? 
    - Absence of menses for 3 months for women who previously had normal menses
    - And 6 months for women who previously had irregular menses 


- Q. What is oligomenorrhea ? 
    - Cycle length >35 days
    - <9 periods in a year 
- #Clinicalpearl
    - Causes of secondary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are similar
    - Both are similar condition just extension of each other 


- Q. What is the 2nd most common cause of  after pregnancy ? 
    - [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Other topics in Female Reproductive endocrinology/Hypothalamic amenorrhea\|Hypothalamic amenorrhea]]


- Q. Can systemic disorders lead to amenorrhea ?
    - Yes
    - They are again hypothalamic amenorrhea
    - Typically seen in type 1 diabetes and celiac
    - Also need to rule out autoimmune causes in above cases


- Q. What is the relation of Type 1 diabetes and amenorrhea ?
    - 70% of girls with type 1 have oligo/amenorrhea
    - More likely if HbA1c > 7.6
    - Even in well controlled type 1 – prevelance is 20%


- Q. What is the link between hypothyroidism and amneorrhea ?
    - More likely with severe hyperthyroidism compared to mild-moderate
    - 2.5% of women with severe hyperthyroidism had amenorrhea


- Q. Does hypothyrodisim produce amenorrhea ?
    - Generally hypothyroidism is associated with excessive menstrual bleed
    - However , rare cases hypothyroidism may also be linked with amenorrhea
    - This is probably due to pituitary hyperplasia and lactotroph hyperplasia seen in uncontrolled hypthyroidism


- Q. Which is the only uterine cause of secondary amenorrhea ?
    - Asherman syndrome  - intrauterine adhesions
    - This is due to previous D and C etc
    - Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea


- **Diagnosis **


- Q. what is the first step in evaluation of [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Secondary amenorrhea\|Secondary amenorrhea]] ?
    - Beta HCG in urine to rule out pregnancy
    - Serum betaHCG is more sensitive


- Q. What is the progesterone withdrawal test ?
    - Medroxyprogesterone – 10 mg for 10 days and then stop.
    - Look for menstrual bleeding


- Q. What is the are tests done to see the estrogen status ?
    - Direct measure of E2 level
    - Progesterone challenge test- withdrawal bleeding suggests normal exposure of endometrium to progesterone
    - Endometrial thickening - <4 mm – suggest hypoestrogenic status


- Q. When is MRI performed based on prolactin levels ?
    - If prolactin is >50 ng/ml – repeated twice and other causes of hyperprolactinemia like drugs and thyroid are ruled out  then MRI is performed


- Q. How is diagnosis of [[Asherman syndrome\|Asherman syndrome]] carried out ?
    - Step 1 – history – amenorrhea with history of uterine instrumentation or DNC- think of asherman
    - Step 2-  progesterone challenge test- if no withdrawal bleeding  Asherman ruled out
    - Step 3- Estrogen + Progesterone challenge test- if bleeding seen – Asherman is ruled out
    - Step 4- if no bleeding → hysterosalpingography or Hysteroscopy


- Q. How is estrogen + progesterone challenge test carried out ?
    - E+ P challenge test
    - Conjugated estrogen – Premarin – 0.625 mg for 35 days
    - Medroxyprogesterone added in dose of 10 mg on days 26-35
