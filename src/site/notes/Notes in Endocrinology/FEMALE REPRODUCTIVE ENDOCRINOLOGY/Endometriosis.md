-   **Introduction**

-   Q. What is Endometriosis?
	-   Endometriosis is the presence of endometrium tissue outside the uterine cavity in ectopic locations


-   Q. What are the clinical features of endometriosis?
	-   Cyclic pelvic pain
	-   Pain on intercourse
	-   Infertility


-   Q. Is it an inherited disease?
	-   It has a polygenic inheritance

-   **Pathology**

-   Q. What are the three classical pathological types and locations in endometriosis?
	-   Pelvic periotenum- periotoneal endometriosis
	-   Ovaries – endometrioma
	-   Between rectum and vagina- rectovaginal nodule


-   Q. How does endometriosis produce infertility?
	-   Pain during intercourse- reduce the frequency
	-   Interfere with ovulation
	-   Block fallopian tubules
	-   Inflammation in the endometrium- prevent implantation


-   Q. When does endometriosis typically appear, and when does it disappear?
	-   Typically appears at menarche and disappears at menopause
	-   Rectovaginal nodules may create a problem even after menopause


-   Q. Which hormone is principally involved in pathogenesis, growth, and symptoms of endometriosis?
	-   Estrogen


-   Q. What are some common theories for the origin of endometriosis?
	-   Endometrial tissues moves down the fallopian tubes and into the peritoneum and ovary
	-   The mesothelial cells in ectopic location differentiate into endometrial tissue
	-   Endometrial tissues passes via lymphatic and veins
	-   Hemopoietic stem cells from bone marrow differentiate into endometrial tissue at the ectopic location


-   Q. What does the target tissue take up the endometrial tissue?
	-   There is defective immune system activation which fails to clear this ectopic tissue
	-   There is a change like cell processes in the ectopic tissue, like in cancer cells


-   Q. What are the important changes that occur in the endometriosis tissue which is targeted during therapy?
	-   Excessive estrogen synthesis
	-   Excessive prostaglandin synthesis
	-   Progesterone resistance


-   **Diagnosis**


-   Q How is a diagnosis of endometriosis made?
	-   From history – cyclic pelvic pain starting during menarche
	-   Direct visualization of peritoneal endometrial tissue on Laparoscopy
	-   Ovarian, endometrial cyst (chocolate cyst) – seen on ultrasound


-   **Treatment**


-   Q. Give an outline of the management of endometriosis?
	-   Ovarian and rectovaginal endometrioma- removed surgically
	-   Pain – NSAIDs and hormonal therapy – block ovarian synthesis
	-   Infertility- Surgical removal of endometrial tissue + ART
	-   Peritoneal implants- LASER to burn the implants
	-   If nothing works for the pain especially- remove both ovaries


-   Q. What is the indication for hormonal therapy?
	-   It is mainly given for the pain


-   Q. Which are the various hormonal agents used in endometriosis?
	-   [[GnRH agonist\|GnRH agonist]]
	-   Danazol
	-   Progestin
	-   OC pills
	-   Aromatase inhibitor – 3rd gen- [[Letrozole\|Letrozole]] / Anastazole


-   Q. Which of these is not used nowadays?
	-   Danazol is not used these days
	-   It produces a lot of androgenization, some of which are irreversible


-   Q. How long is the therapy generally given for pain relief?
	-   Generally for six months
	-   GnRH agonists act faster- OC pills take more time
	-   However, recurrence tends to occur on stopping therapy


-   Q. Is estrogen production suppressed by GnRH agonist?
	-   No
	-   Local estrogen production by endometriosis tissue may remain
	-   Peripheral estrogen production (by fat tissue etc.) is not suppressed by GnRH agonist
	-   This is where aromatase inhibitors are helpful


-   Q. What is the typical algorithm for management as proposed by experts for premenopausal women?
	-   Start with continuous OC pills (may cause breakthrough bleeding at six months)
	-   If pain is relieved with the OC pill- it may be continued till menopause
	-   If pain is still high- add aromatase inhibitor + OC pills
	-   If the pain still continues- GnRH agonist and then surgery


-   Q. Is there any specific biochemical marker for endometriosis?
	-   No
	-   CA125 is elevated. However, elevation is nonspecific


-   Q. What are the long-term risk with endometriosis?
	-   Risk of epithelial ovarian cancer
	-   Atherosclerosis

-   Q. Which tumor marker can be elevated in patients with [[Notes in Endocrinology/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/Endometriosis\|Endometriosis]]?
	-   CA-125


-   Q. What are the treatment options for patients having pelvic pain due to Endometriosis?
	-   In this sequence
		-   NSAIDS
		-   Continuous OCP
		-   GnRH agonist therapy
		-   Aromatase inhibitor
