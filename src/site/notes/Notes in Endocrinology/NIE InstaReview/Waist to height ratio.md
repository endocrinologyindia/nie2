- ## Editorial note:

	- It is time to ditch BMI as marker of obesity - Waist to height ratio is a better marker for obesity 


- ### Title of the article
    - Waist-to-height ratio is a simple tool for assessing central obesity and consequent health risk
- ### First two Authors followed by et al
    - Jimmy Chun Yu Louie and Abraham Wall-Medrano et al.
- ### One line summary of the article
    - The waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is a reliable and simple anthropometric index for assessing central obesity and predicting cardiometabolic risk.
- ### Six key points from the article in a numbered format
    - 1. The waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is more effective than BMI and waist circumference (WC) in predicting cardiometabolic risk.
    - 2. WHtR has a critical boundary value of 0.5, easily communicated as "keep your waist circumference under half your height."
    - 3. Studies have shown WHtR's superiority in predicting conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.
    - 4. WHtR is particularly effective in identifying at-risk individuals who may benefit from early preventive interventions.
    - 5. WHtR is validated as an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome in various demographic groups.
    - 6. WHtR performs better than other anthropometric measures in predicting cardiometabolic risk in both middle-aged and younger populations.
- ### Practical take-home message
    - Keep your waist circumference to less than half your height to reduce the risk of cardiometabolic diseases.
