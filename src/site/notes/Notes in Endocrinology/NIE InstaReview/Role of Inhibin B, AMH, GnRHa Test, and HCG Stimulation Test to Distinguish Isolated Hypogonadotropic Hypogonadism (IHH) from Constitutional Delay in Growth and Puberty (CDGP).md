- ### Title of the Article:
    - Role of Inhibin B, AMH, GnRHa Test, and HCG Stimulation Test to Distinguish Isolated Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (IHH) from Constitutional Delay in Growth and Puberty (CDGP)
- ### First two Authors followed by et al:
    - Bijay K. Sahoo, Padala Ravi Kumar, et al.
- ### One-line Summary of the Article:
    - This study evaluates the diagnostic utility of various hormonal tests to differentiate between isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP) in children.
- ### Six Key Points from the Article:
    - 1. **Diagnosis Criteria**: Delayed puberty is characterized by the absence of testicular enlargement by age 14 in boys and lack of breast development by age 13 in girls.
    - 2. **Study Participants**: Included boys (14-18 years) with testicular volume <4 ml and girls (13-18 years) at Tanner B1 stage.
    - 3. **Tests Performed**: Hormonal analysis including basal LH, FSH, inhibin B, AMH, testosterone (boys), oestradiol (girls), triptorelin stimulation test, and 3-day HCG stimulation test (boys).
    - 4. **Diagnostic Utility**: 4-hour post-triptorelin LH showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for IHH in both sexes; basal inhibin B had high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IHH.
    - 5. **Key Findings**: Post-triptorelin 4-hour LH and inhibin B are reliable tests for distinguishing IHH from CDGP; basal LH, FSH, and AMH were poor discriminators.
    - 6. **Follow-up Results**: Over a follow-up period of 1.5 years, 21 children were diagnosed with CDGP and 13 with IHH, with distinct hormonal profiles aiding diagnosis.
- ### Practical Take Home Message:
    - The post-triptorelin 4-hour LH test and basal inhibin B levels are effective in distinguishing IHH from CDGP, providing a reliable approach for timely and accurate diagnosis in clinical settings.

- ### Protocol for Conducting the Post-Triptorelin 4-Hour LH Test
- 1. **Preparation**:
    - Ensure the patient has fasted overnight (at least 8 hours).
    - Collect a baseline blood sample at 8-9 AM for the estimation of baseline hormones.
- 2. **Administration of Triptorelin**:
    - Administer triptorelin acetate (decapeptyl 0.1 mg/ml) subcutaneously.
    - The dose should be 100 μg/m², with a maximum of 100 μg.
- 3. **Blood Sample Collection**:
    - Collect blood samples 4 hours after the triptorelin injection to measure the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
- 4. **Measurement**:
    - Use the collected blood samples to measure the LH and FSH levels through appropriate laboratory techniques such as chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA).
- 5. **Interpretation**:
    - Compare the post-triptorelin 4-hour LH levels to established cut-off values to differentiate between isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP).
- ### Summary:
    - The Post-Triptorelin 4-Hour LH Test involves fasting, administration of a specific dose of triptorelin acetate, followed by blood sample collection after 4 hours to measure LH levels. This test is used to differentiate IHH from CDGP with high sensitivity and specificity.
