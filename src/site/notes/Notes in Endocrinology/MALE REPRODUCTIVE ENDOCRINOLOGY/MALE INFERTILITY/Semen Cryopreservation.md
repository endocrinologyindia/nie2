- Q. What is the best way for [[fertility preservation\|fertility preservation]] in men?
    - Cryopreservation of sperms is the best option

- Q. What are the indications for [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Semen Cryopreservation\|Semen Cryopreservation]] men?
    - 1. Young post-pubertal men desirous of future fertility who are planned for gonadotoxic chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy
    - 2. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadal men on treatment with gonadotropins 
    - 3. Young post-pubertal men desirous of future fertility planned for pituitary surgery
    - 4. Any other disease on treatment that can potentially impact fertility 
    - 5. Men undergoing vasectomy 
    - 6. In the case of transgender before undergoing surgery for gender congruence 


- Q. How is semen collected in such cases?
    - Semen is generally collected using masturbation


- Q. What is done if no sperm are found on the ejaculated sample?
    - Sperms can be extracted with TESA and cryopreserved


- Q. What is done if the patient cannot ejaculate because of some local neurological issue?
    - Transrectal electroejaculation can be used for collecting the semen


- Q. What is a new experimental cryo technique in men?
    - Cryopreservation of testicular tissue
    - This is still experimental


- Q. What percentage of sperms survive [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Semen Cryopreservation\|Semen Cryopreservation]]?
    - 50% of the sperms


- Q.  What are the three methods for preparing the sperms for [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Semen Cryopreservation\|Semen Cryopreservation]]?
    - 1. Swim-up
    - 2. Density gradient
    - 3. Culture medium


- Q. Which technique would you use for low sperm count?
    - Density gradient 


- Q. What technique would you use for normal sperm count?
    - Swim-up technique 


- Q. What are the methods for cryopreservation of the sample?
    - 1. Slow-freezing
    - 2. Rapid cooling- most commonly used
    - 3. Vitrification 


- Q. What is the medium used for cryoprotection of the sperms?
    - Generally, glycerol is used for cryoprotection of the sperm 


- Q. Can you describe the method for rapid cooling?
    - 1. Semen is mixed with cryoprotectant (Glycerol) in a dropwise manner
    - 2. The mixed sample is placed on a liquid nitrogen vapor for 10-30 minutes
    - 3. Then it is plunged into a liquid nitrogen storage container 


- Q. What is the best ART technique to use when the sperms are in short supply while being stored?
    - Use [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)\|Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]] since it would require only one sperm 
    - Additionally, embryos can be made and preserved 
    - This would be the best utilization of the sperms 


- Q. How long can the sperms be stored?
    - There is no time frame per se
    - The longest storage has been for 24 years


- Q. How many cycles of freezing and thawing can be done?
    - Every cycle of freezing and thawing can cause sperm damage and DNA fragmentation
    - Three cycles of freezing and thawing is generally acceptable 


- Q. Is there any increased risk of birth defects with the use of cryopreservation?
    - No. 
    - There is no evidence to suggest increased birth defects
