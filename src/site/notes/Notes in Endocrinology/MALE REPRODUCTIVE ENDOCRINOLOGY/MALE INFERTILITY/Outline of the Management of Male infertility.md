- Q. What causes of infertility are not treatable by conventional Non ART techniques?
    - Kleinfelter’s
    - Yq microdeletion syndrome
    - Sertoli only syndrome
    - Germ cell development arrest before primary spermatocyte stage
    - Radiation-induced hypogonadism etc


- Q. What are the options for the management of such patients?
    - TESE / Micro TESE with ICSI
    - ART/IUI with Donor sperm
    - Germ cell transplantation


- Q. In which conditions are specific treatments available with good results?
    - Hyperprolactinemia patient- treatment with Cabergoline
    - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patient – treatment with HCG +/- HMG / Recombinant FSH


- Q. Those having increased Leukocyte in the semen, does giving antibiotics helps?
    - Those with >1 million leukocyte /ml may have an infection
    - Give ten days course of Cotrimox / FQ / Erythromycin
    - Repeat test after two weeks
    - If WBC is still present- give another ten days course
    - The impact on infertility is not well known


- Q. What is done for those having sperm antibodies?
    - High dose prednisolone 40-80 mg for six months is found to be helpful in such patients
    - However, ART is another good option


- Q. What is done for retrograde ejaculation?
    - Sperm are extracted from the urine after alkalinization of urine and extensive washing of the sperm


- Q. In those with varicocele, does repair improve fertility outcomes?
    - It is debatable
    - Hence it is not recommended at present


- **Sperm retrieval techniques**


- Q. Enlist the various sperm retrieval techniques?
    - PESA - percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration
    - MESA- Microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration
    - TESA- Testicular sperm aspiration
    - TESE- Testicular sperm extraction
    - Micro – TESE- Microsurgical- TESE


- Q. Which of these are used in obstructive azoospermia?
    - PESA
    - MESA
    - TESA- if above fails
    - PESA and MESA are aspirations from epididymis
    - TESA- is aspiration from Testis


- Q. Which is used for Non-obstructive azoospermia?
    - TESE
    - Micro-TESE
    - TESA- if histopathology is favorable in NOA


- **Empirical therapy**


- Q. Which are the various empirical therapy used in male infertility?
    - Clomiphene
    - Gonadotropins
    - Pentoxyphylline
    - Vitamin E
    - Antiestrogen- Tamoxifen
    - Aromatase inhibitors- Letrozole /anastozole


- Q. Are these empirical therapies recommended?
    - No


- **ART**


- Q. Which is the best ART technique for male factor infertility?
    - ICSI
    - Pearl
    - IVF- Better for non-male factor infertility
    - ICSI- better for male factor infertility


- Q. Summarize the management of infertility in various conditions which work?
    - Hyperprolactinemia- Cabergoline
    - Hypo hypo HCG / HMG, Pulsatile GnRH
    - Obstructive azoospermia – repair of obstruction. If not, then PESA / MESA with ICSI
    - Non-obstructive azoospermia / Kleinfelter’s- TESE/ Micro TESE with ICSI
