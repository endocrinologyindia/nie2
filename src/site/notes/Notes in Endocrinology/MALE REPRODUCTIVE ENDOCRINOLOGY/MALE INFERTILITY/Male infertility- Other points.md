- **Other Genetic anomalies**


- Q. What is  Macrozoospermia?
    - It is a form of  Teratospermia 
    - It is because of the lack of an enzyme called  Aurora kinase C 
    - This enzyme is responsible for the cell division 
    - Because of the lack of this enzyme- the sperms have extra chromosomes, which gives it a large head
    - This abnormal sperm often leads to infertility or miscarriage because of extrachromosomal material


- Q. What is  globozoospermia?
    - This is also a form of  Teratospermia 
    - In this, the head of the sperm is a globe in shape instead of oval because of the lack of the acrosomal cap.
    - This is because of a genetic defect in [DPY19L2](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/dpy19l2/) gene


- **Sperm Retrieval**


- Q. What are the various techniques for Sperm retrieval?
    -  PESA  - Percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration
    -  MESA - Microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration
    -  TESA  - Transcutenous epididymal sperm aspiration 
    -  TESE - Transcutenous epididymal sperm extraction  
    -  MicroTESE 
    -  Vasal Aspirate 


- Q. Which of these techniques is good for obstructive azoospermia?
    - Any of the above may be used for obstructive  Azoospermia 


- Q. Which is better for  Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA)?
    -  MicroTESE 


- **Other points**
- Q. What are the grades of Varicocele?
    - Grade 1- only on cough impulse
    - Grade 2- palpable not visible
    - Grade 3- visible


- Q. When is  ICSI  preferred over conventional IVF?
    - Sperm count - <2 million
    - Motility - <5%
    - Normal morphology <5%
    - Poor sperm – cervical mucous interaction
    - Antisperm antibody


- Q. What is the secular trend in sperm count?
    - There is a secular trend towards falling sperm count


- Q. How many semen analyses must be done before drawing any conclusion?
    - 2-3 samples over 2-3 months


- Q. Does the WHO 2010 data for Semen analysis include Indian patients?
    - No


- Q. Which is the most important parameter in the WHO semen analysis according to Infertility specialists?
    - Most important parameter is morphology
    - Morphology > 4% is associated with sperm count
    - If overrides other factors


- Q. What is leuckocytospermia?
    - It is peroxide positive WBC >10 ^ 6 /ml
    - This generally gives poor results if there are WBC in the sperms


- Q. What is the success rate after  ICSI?
    - 40%


- Q. What is the effect of reactive oxygen species in sperms?
    - It causes DNA fragmentation
    - It may lead to idiopathic male infertility


- Q. What is IMSI?
    - Intracytoplasmic morphologically selection sperm injection


- Q. What is P-ICSI?
    - Petri Dish  ICSI 
    - Use of hyaluronic acid-binding to select sperms for  ICSI 


- Q. What test must be considered for patients with repeated IVF failure?
    - Test for DNA fragmentation


- Q. What is semen preparation?
    - It is washing of semen done to remove debris, WBC, bacteria, etc
    - It is ideally done within 30 min of ejaculation


- Q. Name some semen preparation techniques?
    - Swim-up
    - Density gradient centrifugation
    - Percoll gradient


- Q. What is the sperm cutoff and various ART?
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FXcJEKe9B0E.png?alt=media&token=4a0329ae-afb1-4a7b-956b-0312aac4327f)


- Q. Which is the oldest sperm function test?
    - Sperm – cervical mucus interaction
    - Not used much these days


- Q. What is the investigation of choice for immotile sperm?
    - Hypoosmotic sperm swelling


- Q. When should genetic testing be considered for male infertility?
    - When sperm count <10 million / ml


- Q. Which mutation is specifically associated with azoospermia?
    - Yq microdeletion = AZF – azoospermia factor deleted


- Q. Which is the newest deletion recorded?
    - Gr/gr deletion- increase risk of oligospermia and also testicular germ cell tumors


- Q. Should varicocele with OAT/Azoospermia be treated?
    - Yes
    - Evidence suggests there is improvement in sperm parameters and fertility after Surgery of varicocele


- Q. How does varicocele impact male fertility?
    - It increases reactive oxygen species and causes DNA fragmentation
    - it reduces the sperm count
    - It leads to smaller size testis and also lowers the testosterone
