        - Hyperprolactinemia
    - Testicular causes
        - Congenital
            - Kleinfelter syndrome

        - Acquired
            - Viral orchitis
            - Testicular trauma
            - Torsion

            - Torsion
            - Drugs
            - Environmental toxins
    - Post testicular
        - Absent seminal vesicule or vas deferens
        - Obstruction of Sperm ejaculation pathway
        - Ejaculatory disorder- ED, Premature ejactation ,retrograde ejaculation
    - Idiopathic
        - 40-50% cases


- Q. How common is Yq microdeletion?
    - More common than we thing
    - 20% of infertile men have it


- Q. Which region in chromosome Y is defective in Yq microdeletion?
    - The defect lies in the long arm of chromosome Y
    - The defect is in the Azospermic region (AZF)
    - There are three regions of AZF- AZFa, b, and C
    - Asia and b involvement- azoospermia
    - AZFc- oligospermia


- Q. What does the biopsy show?
    - Germ cell arrest
    - Sertoli only syndrome


- Q. Which genes in these regions are defects?
    - USP9Y
    - DDX3Y


- Q. Can this disease be transmitted?
    - If the sperms of these males are used for ICSI- then yes, it is transmitted to offspring
    - Hence Yq microdeletion testing is offered to these men before ICSI


- Q. What test must be done if there is a bilateral absence of Vas Deferens?
    - CFTR gene mutation for Cystic fibrosis


- **Genetic causes of Male infertility**


- Q. Name the key genetic causes of male infertility 
    - CFTR mutation
        -  This produces a congenital absence of vas deferens
    - [[Klienfelter syndrome\|Klienfelter syndrome]] - The most common cause
    - Y chromosome microdeletions producing [[Y Chromosome infertility\|Y Chromosome infertility]]
    - Genetic causes attribute to 15-30% of male infertility 
    - Chromosomal abnormalities produce more severe disorders like [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|Azoospermia]] or severe [[oligospermia\|oligospermia]] 


- Q. What is [[AZF\|AZF]]?
    - AZF is a region on the long arm of chromosome Y which is associated with infertility in men
    - This produces a condition called [[Y Chromosome infertility\|Y Chromosome infertility]]
    - There are three regions - AZFa, AZFb, AZFc
    - Deletion in AZFa and AZFb produce [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|Azoospermia]] 
    - Deletion in AZFc produce severe [[oligospermia\|oligospermia]] - however, enough sperms are produced for sperm extraction using [[TESE\|TESE]] and use for [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)\|Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]]


- Q. Summarize the genetic causes of [[male infertility\|male infertility]]

- Q. What is [[Robertsonian translocation\|Robertsonian translocation]] ?
    - Answer from [[Wiki\|Wiki]]: 
        - "**Robertsonian translocation** (ROB) is a chromosomal abnormality wherein a certain type of a chromosome becomes attached to another. It is the most common form of chromosomal **translocation** in humans, affecting 1 out of every 1,000 babies born."


- Q. What does [[INSL3-LGR8\|INSL3-LGR8]] mutation produce ?
    - It produces [[cryptorchidism\|cryptorchidism]]


- Q. What is [[Sertoli cell-only syndrome\|Sertoli cell-only syndrome]] ?
    - This is a histological syndrome.
    - This is typically seen in young males between 20-40 years
    - On Semen analysis they have [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|Azoospermia]] or severe oligospermia
    - On Histopathology- the seminiferous tubules are lined with [[Sertoli cells\|Sertoli cells]] only and little or no spermatogenesis takes place
    - the testis may be slightly atrophied
    - [[Inhibin B\|Inhibin B]] levels may be low 
    - [[FSH\|FSH]] is elevated with normal LH
    - The male is otherwise normally virilized
    - The likely etiology is likely to be [[Y Chromosome infertility\|Y Chromosome infertility]] due to [[AZF\|AZF]] microdeletions
    - Similar situation can also be acquired due to toxins which damage the sperm production 


- Q. What are the [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome\|Androgen insensitivity syndrome]]
    - There are three types of [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome\|Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] 
        - Complete Androgen insensitivity syndrome- 46, XY presenting as a female
        - Partial Androgen insensitivity syndrome- 46, XY DSD presenting with [[atypical genitalia\|atypical genitalia]]
        - Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome- presenting as male phenotype with [[Gynecomastia\|Gynecomastia]] and reduce androgenization 


- Q. Tell me something about [[congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD)\|congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD)]] ?
    - This is caused by [[CFTR\|CFTR]] gene.
    - The patient is a phenotype male with normal testicular sperm production but absent vas deferens leading to [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|Azoospermia]]
    - The same gene also produces [[cystic fibrosis\|cystic fibrosis]]
    - The patient may or may not have clinical features of cystic fibrosis
