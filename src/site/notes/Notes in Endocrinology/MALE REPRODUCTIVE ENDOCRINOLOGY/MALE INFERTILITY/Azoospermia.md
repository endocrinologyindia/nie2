- Q. Give a broad outline for a patient with [[male infertility\|male infertility]] 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FyjnUuW2Epp.png?alt=media&token=243312ec-ddde-410c-af2c-fa6eca7c863e)

- Q. What is Azoospermia?
    - Azoospermia is defined as a complete absence of sperms in the ejaculate 


- Q. How is Azoospermia confirmed?
    - Must be confirmed on two separate occasion
    - Using Centrifugation of the semen for 15 min at 3000 pm


- Q. Which are three broad categories of azoospermia?
    - Pretesticular- hormonal causes- secondary testicular failure
    - Testicular- Primary testicular failure
    - Post testicular – obstructive azoospermia


- Q. Give a broad outline of how you will differentiate between these three types of azoospermia?

- Q. Give an approach to azoospermia with normal FSH, LH, and testosterone?

- Q.  Why is the volume of ejaculate essential while dealing with azoospermia?
    - Ask if the volume of ejaculate is one teaspoon or few drops (1-6 ml)
    - if the volume is low- it suggests
    - Seminal vesicle absent
    - Seminal vesicle non-functioning
    - Obstruction post-ejaculatory duct


- Q. What is the best way to look for absent vas deferns?
    - Clinical examination is often enough!
    - But TRUS may confirm


- Q. What is done if vas deferens is absent?
    - PESA followed by ICSI


- Q. What is the problem with fructose in the semen test?
    - Fructose comes from the seminal vesicle
    - However, at least 1 ml of ejaculate required to do the test


- Q. How are anti-sperm antibodies detected?
    - They are detected using MAR test and immunobead test


- Q. What is the role of empirical medical therapy in patients with [[Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA)\|Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA)]] ?
    - It helps in increasing the sperm yield in the various sperm extraction methods


- Q. Which are the drugs used for the above purpose?
    - Clomiphene citrate
    - Aromatase inhibitor – anastazole
    - Gonadotropins- HCG


- Q. Does clomiphene improve sperm count in patients with OAT syndrome?
    - Improvement in sperm count with clomiphene in males has been debated
    - There is some role in the improvement of testosterone


- Q. Why would HCG be helpful if the LH/FSH is high?
    - It would help to rest the endogenous gonadotropins
    - So there is some help even if LH and FSH are high


- Q. Enlist the causes of [[obstructive azoospermia\|obstructive azoospermia]]?
    - [[congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD)\|congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD)]]
    - Congenital absence of epididymis
    - epididymal cyst- due to prenatal [[diehtyestilbesterol exposure\|diehtyestilbesterol exposure]]
    - Vasectomy
    - Post-infectious fibrosis of genital tract 
        - Chlamydia
        - Gonorrhea
        - Leprosy
        - Tuberculosis
    - [[Young syndrome\|Young syndrome]]


- Q. Name the key genetic causes of male infertility that can lead to [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|azoospermia]] 
    - CFTR mutation
        -  This produces a congenital absence of vas deferens
    - [[Klienfelter syndrome\|Klienfelter syndrome]] - The most common cause
    - Y chromosome microdeletions producing [[Y Chromosome infertility\|Y Chromosome infertility]]
    - Genetic causes attribute to 15-30% of male infertility 
    - Chromosomal abnormalities produce more severe disorders like [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|azoospermia]] or severe [[oligospermia\|oligospermia]] 


- **Sperm retrieval techniques **


- Q. What are the various techniques for Sperm retrieval?
    - [[PESA\|PESA]] - Percutenous epididymal sperm aspiration
    - [[MESA\|MESA]]- Microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration
    - [[TESA\|TESA]] - Transcutenous epididymal sperm apsiration 
    - [[TESE\|TESE]]- Transcutenous epididymal sperm extraction  
    - [[MicroTESE\|MicroTESE]]
    - [[Vasal Aspirate\|Vasal Aspirate]]


- Q. Which of these techniques is suitable for  [[obstructive azoospermia\|obstructive azoospermia]]?
    - Any of the above may be used for obstructive [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|azoospermia]]


- Q. Which is better for [[Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA)\|Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA)]] ?
    - [[MicroTESE\|MicroTESE]]


- Q. What is [[MicroTESE\|MicroTESE]]?
    - Here, the entire [[seminiferous tubule\|seminiferous tubule]] is extracted using microsurgical techniques 


- Q. What is PESA?
    - Percutenous epididymal sperm aspiration
    - This is the simplest method of sperm extraction


- Q. What is the most standard method for sperm aspiration?
    - TESA
    - Also called needle aspiration biopsy – NAB


- Q. What is MESA?
    - Microepididymal sperm aspiration
    - A more complicated procedure
    - Yet it gives less yield
