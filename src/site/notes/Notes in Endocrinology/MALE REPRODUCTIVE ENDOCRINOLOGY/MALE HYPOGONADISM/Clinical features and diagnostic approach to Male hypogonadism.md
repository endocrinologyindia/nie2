- Q. Why is the timing of testosterone defect important in congenital abnormalities of primary hypogonadism?
    - Defect in 1st trimester- male external genitalia would not be adequately formed – ambiguous genitalia or female external genitalia
    - Normal Trimester in the first trimester but defective in 3rd trimester  - micropenis at birth
    - Normal Testosterone in utero, Testosterone defect before puberty- absent secondary sexual characteristic, Eunhacnoid proportions, gynecomastia
    - Testosterone defect after puberty – normal virilization, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, reduced libido, infertility


- Q. What is the typical phallus length in prepubertal testosterone deficiency?
    - Stretched penile length <8 cm


- Q. What are the features of Prepubertal testosterone deficiency?
    - Eunuchoid proportions
    - Absent spermarche
    - Small testis
    - Small phallus - <8 cm
    - May have gynecomastia
    - Absent acne
    - Absent temporal hair recession
    - High pitched voice
    - Body composition - female
    - Female eschaton
    - Reduce muscle mass
    - Absent pigmentation and rugosity of scrotum


- Q. What are the features of eunuchoid proportions?
    - lower segment > Upper segment by 2 cm
    - Arm spam > height by 5 cm


- Q. Summarize the clinical features of male hypogonadism based on the age of onset and whether it is primary or secondary hypogonadism? 

Prepubertal onset of hypogonadism 

| Clinical feature      | Primary hypogonadism | Secondary hypogonadism |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Reduced libido        | +                    | +                      |
