- Q. How common is Klinefelter syndrome (KS) ?
    - 1:1000 live births


- Q. Can 46 XX have KS?
    - Yes
    - It could be because of translocation of testis determining factor on the X chromosome


- Q.  What is the difference in terms of timing of non-disjunction in 46 XXY vs. Mosaic Klinefelter's?
    - 46 XXY occurs because of non-disjunction of either parent during meiosis
    - Mosaicism occurs due to non-disjunction during mitotic division


- Q. What is the typical psychosocial manifestation of Klinefelter's?
    - Poor insight
    - Lack of judgment
    - Inability to learn from past adverse experiences


- Q. What happens to linguistic abilities in Klienfetler's?
    - Higher linguistic capacity is lost
    - Sparing of vocabulary and understanding of language


- Q. What happens to attention span on KS?
    - Inability to sustain attention
    - But no impulsivity


- Q. What other systems are involved in KS?
    - Pulmonary involvement- increase risk of bronchiectasis, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis
    - Increased risk of germ cell tumors – including extragonadal germ cell tumors
    - Increased risk of breast cancer
    - Increased risk of NHL
    - Increased risk of varicose veins
    - SLE
    - Diabetes mellitus


- Q. Mortality from which cancer is reduced in Klinefelter's?
    - Mortality from Prostate cancer is reduced


- Q. What is the importance of CAG repeats in KS?
    - The more the CAG repeats- the less the transactivation of androgen receptors
    - Longer CAG repeats in KS- more tall stature, lesser BMD, and more severe the hypogonadism


- Q. Enlist the essential clinical features of Klinefelter's syndrome?
    - Adults
        - Infertility
        - Azoospermia
        - Pulmonary involvement- Broncheactesis etc
        - Small testis
        - Gynecomastia
        - Mitral valve prolapse
        - Osteoporosis and fracture
        - Increase the risk of cancer- breast, NHL, germ cell tumors
        - Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome
    - Children
        - Behavioural problems
        - Tall stature
        - Delayed puberty or pubertal arrest
        - Delayed speech
        - Cryptorchidism
        - Mediastinal cancers
        - Congenital malformation- cleft lip, cleft palate


- Q. Which gene is thought to influence the phenotype in KS?
    - It is probably SHOX located in XP
    - This is the opposite of what is seen in Turner's, where there is SHOX haploinsufficiency


- Q. What are the transcriptional targets of SHOX?
    - Brain natriuretic peptide
    - FGFR3


- Q. Do patients with KS have a shorter lifespan?
    - Yes, reduced by 1.5-2 years compared to peers


- Q. Which cancers are increased in KS?
    - Breast cancer- 50 times increase risk
    - NHL
    - Lung cancer
    - Extragonadal germ cell tumors – especially mediastinal germinomas


- Q. Do patients with KS have more criminal intent?
    - Yes
    - They have an increased likelihood to perform sexual crimes and arson
    - And lesser likelihood to perform traffic offenses and drug-related crimes


- Q. What is the typical testicular biopsy finding in KS?
    - Hyalinization of the seminiferous tubule with Leydig cell hyperplasia


- Q. When does the hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules start?
    - It starts are around mid puberty when the testicular volume is around 6 ml
    - Hence patients with KS have normal pubertal development till the TV of 6 ml and then arrest without further increases in the size of the testis or further pubertal development


- Q. What happens to the hormones in KS patients compared to controls?
    - Testosterone – lower
    - Estradiol- same as control
    - FSH and LH- higher
    - SHBG- same as controls
    - Inhibin B-, AMH- lower


- Q. Do patients with KS have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome and Diabetes mellitus?
    - Yes
    - And this probably starts at puberty
    - It is probably because of lower testosterone


- Q. What is a difference in body composition in KS patients compared to controls?
    - KS patients are taller and have more abdominal fat compared to peer
    - BMI may be the same, but more central adiposity


- Q. What is the impact on bones?
    - Patients with KS have lower BMD and increase fracture risk compared to peers
    - Easy to understand with lower testosterone


- Q. Which neurocognitive domain is most impaired in KS patients?
    - They have defective verbal communications
    - They have delayed the development of speech
    - They are not able to understand non-verbal cues
    - Difficulty in reading and spelling
    - Difficulty in syntax


- Q. What about IQ?
    - It is similar to controls


- Q. What about arithmetic?
    - Similar to control


- Q. Does testosterone therapy improve neurocognitive impairments?
    - Results are mixed


- Q. Do patients with kS have more psychiatric problems?
    - Yes
    - There is more likelihood of being referred to psychiatric care in KS patients
    - Patients with Schizophrenia are more likely to have KS


- **Management of patients with Klinefelter syndrome**


- Q. When is BMD-DEXA done in a patient with Kleinfeter's?
    - At baseline
    - Then every 2 years


- Q. What care must be taken while managing children with KS?
    - They must be referred to speech therapists


- Q. When should testosterone be started in boys with KS?
    - Must be started close to puberty
    - Helps improve the androgenic status and also BMD


- Q. How long should they be treated?
    - They must be treated lifelong


- Q. Which cancers are increased in KS?
    - Breast cancer- 50 times increase risk
    - NHL
    - Lung cancer
    - Extragonadal germ cell tumors – especially mediastinal germinomas


- Q. When does the hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules start?
    - It starts are around mid puberty when the testicular volume is an around 6 ml
    - Hence patients with KS have normal pubertal development till the TV of 6 ml and then arrest without further increases in the size of the testis or further pubertal development


- Q. When should testosterone be started in boys with KS?
    - Must be started close to puberty
    - Helps improve the androgenic status and also BMD


- Q. How long should they be treated?
    - They must be treated lifelong


- Q. What should be the target while treating patients with KS?
    - Bring testosterone in mid-normal range
    - Mid LH in mid-normal range
    - However, normalization of LH may not be feasible in all cases because of its effect on hematocrit


- Q. Can patients with [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE HYPOGONADISM/Klinefelter syndrome\|Klinefelter syndrome]] have normal Total [[Testosterone\|Testosterone]] levels?
    - Yes
    - Klinefelter syndrome leads to an increase of [[SHBG\|SHBG]]
    - Because of this, some of the patients may have low normal Total testosterone levels
    - However, the free testosterone levels are surely elevated 
    - This is especially true for mosaic Klinefelter's 


- Q. Is FSH higher in [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE HYPOGONADISM/Klinefelter syndrome\|Klinefelter syndrome]] or LH is more elevated?
    - Either can be higher 
    - There is no fixed pattern 


- Q. Is the FSH value affected by [[biotin\|biotin]]?
    - Just like the thyroid function test, the FSH value is also often affected by a high intake of biotin (usually given for hair loss)
    - FSH levels tend to be lower in patients on high biotin intake when the test is done using sandwich biotin-streptavidin capture assay
