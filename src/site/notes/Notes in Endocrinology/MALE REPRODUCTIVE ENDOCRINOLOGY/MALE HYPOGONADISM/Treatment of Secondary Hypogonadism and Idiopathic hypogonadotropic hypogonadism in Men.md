- **Induction of fertility in males with secondary hypogonadism **


- Q. What are the factor that influences fertility in males with secondary hypogonadism?
    - Bilateral cryptorchidism or unilateral – with no spontaneous descent my one year – reduces the chances
    - Larger the size, of testis-better the response
    - Hypo hypo after puberty have a better response than those before puberty
    - Partial hypogonadism – better response than complete hypogonadism
    - Prior treatment with Testosterone reduces chances for fertility


- **Gonadotropin therapy **


- Q. Describe the current protocol used for management of fertility using gonadotropins for  patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism at Zydus hospital 
    - Baseline assessment
        - Testicular volume
        - SPL
        - FSH
        - LH
        - Testosterone
        - Inhibin B
        - Bone age
    - If TV < 4 ml with/without Inhibin B <60 pg/ml +/- Cryptorchidism
        - Start with HMG 150 IU three times a week
        - After 2 months
            - Repeat Inhibin B
            - FSH
        - If FSH 4-8 IU/l , TV >4 ml has improved, and Inhibin B is >60 pg/ml, then add HCG
        - If the patient has symptoms of Hypogonadism- Testosterone may be temporarily added
    - If TV >4 ml / Acquired hypogonadism , Inhibin B >60 , No cryptorchidism
        - Start with HCG 1500 IU twice a week and HMG 75 IU twice a week
        - Add Letrozole 2.5 mg daily
        - After 6 weeks
            - TV
            - FSH
            - Testosterone - done on day 4 after last HCG dose - repeat every 6 weeks till in normal range
            - Hemoglobin
        - Titrate the dose of HCG to achieve
            - Normal T levels
            - No Erythrocytosis
        - Titrate HMG to achieve
            - FSH value of 4-8 IU/ml
    - When to take semen analysis
        - Start Semen analysis once the TV is 8 ml
        - After 2-3 days of abstinence
        - Repeat every 2-3 weeks
        - Once sperm count is good, consider cryopreservation of sperm, after which the patient may be shifted to HCG alone


- Q. Can LH/HCG alone stimulate spermatogenesis?
    - It often does due to improvement in intratesticular testosterone


- Q. Is recombinant LH better than HCG?
    - No
    - HCG is good enough
    - Recombinant LH has a shorter half-life than HCG and hence needs to be given daily
    - Also, it is more expensive


- Q. How is HCG given- subcutaneously or intramuscularly?
    - It is recommended to be used IM
    - However, it can be given subcutaneously (though not approved for this route)


- Q. What is the starting dose for HCG?
    - 1500-2000 IU intramuscularly twice/three times a week – Mon, Wed, Friday


- Q. How is monitoring done with HCG treatment?
    - Testosterone is measured every 1-2 months
    - It is kept in the range of 400-800 ng/dl
    - If this range is not achieved, increased the dose of HCG
    - If dose >10,000 IU- 3 times a week –then think of anti HCG antibodies


- Q. When to start measuring the sperm count?
    - Sperm count is measured after testosterone has been in the normal range of 400-800 ng/dl
    - Semen analysis can be done every 1-2 months
    - However, semen analysis must not be used to determine response to therapy


- Q. How much sperm count do we target?
    - 5-10 million / ml


- Q. How much time does it take to achieve this sperm count?
    - 6 months  - 24 months!


- Q. When is HMG / FSH added?
    - If the sperm count is <5 million/ml even though testosterone has been normal for >6months
    - Then add HMG/FSH
    - Recently, experts recommend starting FSH/HMG early 


- Q. FSH is required for initiation or maintenance of spermatogenesis?
    - Spermatogenesis is initiated by FSH but probably not required for maintenance


- Q. How does FSH impact spermatogenesis?
    - It impacts spermatogenesis via its action of Sertoli cells


- Q. What is the starting dose of HMG used?
    - 75 Units three times a week – can be given in the same syringe as HCG


- Q. How is monitoring done once on HMG?
    - Monitor Sperm count every 1-2 months
    - Sperm counts fluctuate, so look for a trend


- Q. When is the dose of HMG increased?
    - It is increased to 150 units if the sperm count remains <5 million/ml after 6 months


- Q.. Is it worthwhile to continue HCG / HMG if sperm counts are a few million?
    - Yes
    - Sometimes, this low value can also lead to impregnation


- Q. What is the advantage of Recombinant FSH (rhFSH)?
    - It is mainly developed for ovulation induction and offers no particular advantage to the patient
    - It has not been head-on compared with HMG, but  extra purity of FSH may not be particularly required


- Q. What is the meantime to achieving normal sperm count and fertility?
    - Mean to first sperm is 7.1 month
    - Mean to fertility is 28 months!


- Q. When is ART considered?
    - When pregnancy is not achieved within 12-24 months, ART must be considered
    - Options are Intrauterine insemination, IVF or ICSI (last option)


- Q. What is done once fertility is achieved?
    - HCG and HMG are continued till 1st trimester of pregnancy
    - After delivery, if the couple plan to conceive again, HCG is continued, and HMG is added when pregnancy is planned
    - If pregnancy is not planned again  - then shift to testosterone or continue HCG


- Q. What is done for cryptorchidism in CHH patients in infancy?
    - Surgery is done between 6-12 months of age


- Q. What is done for the micropenis?
    - Testosterone, DHT, or FSH/LH between 1-6 months of age


- Q. Can FSH given during infancy induce spermatogenesis?
    - No
    - It cannot
    - Because Sertoli cells are not affected as they do not have androgen receptors in childhood
    - Androgen receptors of Sertoli cells develop after five years of age


- Q. How is testosterone therapy initiated or maintained in a child with hypo hypo?
    - Start with a low dose of 50 mg
    - Gradually increase to full adult dose over 2 years


- Q. A child on testosterone therapy has an increase in the size of the testis. What does it indicate?
    - Testosterone does not increase the size of the testis
    - So, if the testis size has increased, it suggests a spontaneous reversal of the disease and hence stop testosterone and re-evaluate the HPG axis


- Q. Describe the GnRH pump therapy 
    - GnRH is administered 24 hours a day (even during sleeping and bathing) at 90-minute intervals through a pump with a needle, which is introduced under the skin of the abdomen (subcutaneous). The pump can also be attached via a thin hose into a vein in the lower arm (intravenous). The pump is the most significant disadvantage of the treatment.


- Q. Give the protocol for GnRH administration?
    - It is injected using a pump
    - IV is preferred to subcutaneous
    - A pulse is given every 60-90 min
    - Dose is 2.5-5 mcg per pulse

  Q: What is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and how is it diagnosed?

**A:** Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a condition characterized by low sex hormone production due to impaired signaling from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Proper diagnosis requires:

- Comprehensive medical history and physical examination
- Laboratory confirmation of low testosterone levels with low/normal gonadotropins (LH and FSH)
- Exclusion of secondary causes
- Evaluation of other pituitary hormones when appropriate
- Genetic testing (increasingly recommended for congenital cases)

  Q: What are the main treatment goals for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism?

**A:** Treatment goals typically fall into two categories:

1. **Symptom relief and virilization:** Addressing issues like sexual dysfunction, low energy, decreased muscle mass, and bone health
2. **Fertility induction:** Restoring or establishing reproductive capacity

The choice of regimen depends primarily on which goal is prioritized, along with patient-specific factors such as age, duration of hypogonadism, and comorbidities.

  Q: What is the current best regimen for symptom relief and virilization?

**A:** For men not seeking fertility, standard testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) remains the first-line treatment:

- **Formulations:** Testosterone enanthate or cypionate (commonly 100–200 mg IM every 2–4 weeks), transdermal gels/patches, subcutaneous pellets, or oral preparations
- **Dosing:** Adjusted to target mid-normal serum testosterone
- **Monitoring:** Serum testosterone, hematocrit, liver function tests, PSA (in men >40), bone mineral density, and cardiovascular risk assessment

TRT effectively improves sexual function, muscle mass, bone density, energy levels, and mood but suppresses natural testosterone production and spermatogenesis.

  Q: What are the best regimens for fertility induction?

**A:** Several evidence-based approaches exist:

1. **Pulsatile GnRH Therapy**
    
    - Delivery via infusion pump (e.g., 25 ng/kg every 2 hours)
    - Most physiologic approach for patients with intact pituitary function
    - Effectively mimics natural hormone pulsatility
2. **hCG Monotherapy**
    
    - 3,000–5,000 IU per week (divided into 2–3 injections)
    - Increases intratesticular testosterone and enables spermatogenesis in some cases
    - Best for mild cases
3. **Combined Gonadotropin Therapy (Standard Protocol)**
    
    - Initiate hCG (1,000–2,000 IU every 2–3 days) with FSH (75–150 IU three times weekly)
    - Superior outcomes compared to monotherapy (67% vs. 52% sperm recovery rate)
    - Faster recovery (10 months vs. 33 months with hCG alone)
4. **Sequential Therapy**
    
    - FSH pretreatment for 4 months before adding hCG
    - Particularly beneficial for patients with small testes or history of cryptorchidism
    - May enhance spermatogenic response

  Q: What are the combination protocols using both testosterone and gonadotropins?

**A:** Several combination approaches have been developed:

1. **Low-dose hCG plus Testosterone (LFT Regimen)**
    
    - Low-dose hCG (125–500 IU every other day)
    - Testosterone (200 mg IM weekly or biweekly)
    - Maintains both serum and intratesticular testosterone
    - Supports spermatogenesis while providing symptom relief
    - Unlike testosterone alone, doesn't fully suppress the HPG axis
2. **Sequential TRT → Gonadotropin Therapy**
    
    - Testosterone used first for virilization, then switched to gonadotropins when fertility is desired
    - Recent studies show prior TRT doesn't negatively impact later fertility outcomes
    - Practical when gonadotropins are initially unavailable or unaffordable
3. **Course Combination Therapy**
    
    - Alternating courses of testosterone and hCG
    - Shows better results for sperm concentration restoration compared to testosterone monotherapy
    - Maintains testicular function better than testosterone alone
4. **Low-dose Testosterone with Concurrent Gonadotropins**
    
    - Low-dose testosterone (e.g., 20 mg/day transdermal) alongside gonadotropins
    - In some cases, may help activate rather than suppress the HPG axis
    - Can support both symptom relief and fertility goals

  Q: What monitoring is needed during treatment?

**A:** Recommended monitoring includes:

- Testosterone levels (target mid-normal physiologic range)
- Hemoglobin/hematocrit (watching for erythrocytosis)
- Liver function tests
- Prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal exam in men >40 years
- Bone mineral density assessment
- Cardiovascular risk assessment
- Testicular volume measurement
- Semen analysis when fertility is the goal
- Inhibin B levels (as a marker of Sertoli cell function)

  Q: Are there any special considerations for specific patient groups?

**A:** Yes, treatment should be tailored to:

1. **Infants with HH**
    
    - Early gonadotropin therapy induces "mini-puberty"
    - Increases penile length and testicular growth
    - Facilitates testicular descent in 73% of cases
    - May optimize future fertility potential
2. **Adolescents with HH**
    
    - Gonadotropin therapy can induce puberty more physiologically
    - Sometimes combined with low-dose testosterone to accelerate virilization
    - Supports testicular growth that's not achieved with testosterone alone
3. **Patients with Long-term Hypogonadism**
    
    - May require higher doses or longer treatment duration
    - Response may be less robust than in those with shorter duration

  Q: What are the safety concerns with different regimens?

**A:** Important safety considerations include:

1. **Testosterone Therapy**
    
    - Long-term testosterone exposure associated with 55% increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in men over 51
    - Erythrocytosis is the most common dose-related adverse effect
    - Regular monitoring of hematocrit and cardiovascular risk factors is essential
2. **Gonadotropin Therapy**
    
    - Generally well-tolerated with fewer systemic side effects
    - Local injection site reactions may occur
    - Cost is significantly higher than testosterone therapy
    - Some insurance plans may not provide coverage

  Q: Are there any emerging or novel treatments?

**A:** Several promising approaches are under investigation:

1. **Kisspeptin-based Therapies**
    
    - Kisspeptin is a key component of the GnRH pulse generator
    - Exogenous administration can stimulate the reproductive axis
    - May provide more physiological stimulation than direct hormone replacement
    - Currently in clinical trials
2. **Leflutrozole**
    
    - Selective aromatase inhibitor being studied in clinical trials
    - May enhance endogenous gonadotropin production
3. **Personalized Genetic-based Protocols**
    
    - Treatment selection based on specific genetic variants
    - May improve response prediction and treatment efficacy

  Q: What's the bottom line on current best regimens?

**A:** The optimal approach to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is increasingly personalized:

- **For symptom management only:** Testosterone replacement therapy remains the standard
- **For fertility induction:** Combination gonadotropin therapy (hCG + FSH/hMG) shows superior outcomes
- **For dual goals:** Low-dose hCG plus testosterone protocols may maintain fertility while providing symptom relief
- **For all patients:** Treatment should be individualized based on goals, age, comorbidities, and response

Recent evidence supports the efficacy of combination approaches in specific clinical scenarios, though standardized protocols continue to evolve as more research becomes available.
