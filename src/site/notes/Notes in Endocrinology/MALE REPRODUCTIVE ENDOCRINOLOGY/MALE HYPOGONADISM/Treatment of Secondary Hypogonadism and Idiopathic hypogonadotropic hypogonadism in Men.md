- **Induction of fertility in males with secondary hypogonadism **


- Q. What are the factor that influences fertility in males with secondary hypogonadism?
    - Bilateral cryptorchidism or unilateral – with no spontaneous descent my one year – reduces the chances
    - Larger the size, of testis-better the response
    - Hypo hypo after puberty have a better response than those before puberty
    - Partial hypogonadism – better response than complete hypogonadism
    - Prior treatment with Testosterone reduces chances for fertility


- **Gonadotropin therapy **


- Q. Describe the current protocol used for management of fertility using gonadotropins for  patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism at Zydus hospital 
    - Baseline assessment
        - Testicular volume
        - SPL
        - FSH
        - LH
        - Testosterone
        - Inhibin B
        - Bone age
    - If TV < 4 ml with/without Inhibin B <60 pg/ml +/- Cryptorchidism
        - Start with HMG 150 IU three times a week
        - After 2 months
            - Repeat Inhibin B
            - FSH
        - If FSH 4-8 IU/l , TV >4 ml has improved, and Inhibin B is >60 pg/ml, then add HCG
        - If the patient has symptoms of Hypogonadism- Testosterone may be temporarily added
    - If TV >4 ml / Acquired hypogonadism , Inhibin B >60 , No cryptorchidism
        - Start with HCG 1500 IU twice a week and HMG 75 IU twice a week
        - Add Letrozole 2.5 mg daily
        - After 6 weeks
            - TV
            - FSH
            - Testosterone - done on day 4 after last HCG dose - repeat every 6 weeks till in normal range
            - Hemoglobin
        - Titrate the dose of HCG to achieve
            - Normal T levels
            - No Erythrocytosis
        - Titrate HMG to achieve
            - FSH value of 4-8 IU/ml
    - When to take semen analysis
        - Start Semen analysis once the TV is 8 ml
        - After 2-3 days of abstinence
        - Repeat every 2-3 weeks
        - Once sperm count is good, consider cryopreservation of sperm, after which the patient may be shifted to HCG alone


- Q. Can LH/HCG alone stimulate spermatogenesis?
    - It often does due to improvement in intratesticular testosterone


- Q. Is recombinant LH better than HCG?
    - No
    - HCG is good enough
    - Recombinant LH has a shorter half-life than HCG and hence needs to be given daily
    - Also, it is more expensive


- Q. How is HCG given- subcutaneously or intramuscularly?
    - It is recommended to be used IM
    - However, it can be given subcutaneously (though not approved for this route)


- Q. What is the starting dose for HCG?
    - 1500-2000 IU intramuscularly twice/three times a week – Mon, Wed, Friday


- Q. How is monitoring done with HCG treatment?
    - Testosterone is measured every 1-2 months
    - It is kept in the range of 400-800 ng/dl
    - If this range is not achieved, increased the dose of HCG
    - If dose >10,000 IU- 3 times a week –then think of anti HCG antibodies


- Q. When to start measuring the sperm count?
    - Sperm count is measured after testosterone has been in the normal range of 400-800 ng/dl
    - Semen analysis can be done every 1-2 months
    - However, semen analysis must not be used to determine response to therapy


- Q. How much sperm count do we target?
    - 5-10 million / ml


- Q. How much time does it take to achieve this sperm count?
    - 6 months  - 24 months!


- Q. When is HMG / FSH added?
    - If the sperm count is <5 million/ml even though testosterone has been normal for >6months
    - Then add HMG/FSH
    - Recently, experts recommend starting FSH/HMG early 


- Q. FSH is required for initiation or maintenance of spermatogenesis?
    - Spermatogenesis is initiated by FSH but probably not required for maintenance


- Q. How does FSH impact spermatogenesis?
    - It impacts spermatogenesis via its action of Sertoli cells


- Q. What is the starting dose of HMG used?
    - 75 Units three times a week – can be given in the same syringe as HCG


- Q. How is monitoring done once on HMG?
    - Monitor Sperm count every 1-2 months
    - Sperm counts fluctuate, so look for a trend


- Q. When is the dose of HMG increased?
    - It is increased to 150 units if the sperm count remains <5 million/ml after 6 months


- Q.. Is it worthwhile to continue HCG / HMG if sperm counts are a few million?
    - Yes
    - Sometimes, this low value can also lead to impregnation


- Q. What is the advantage of Recombinant FSH (rhFSH)?
    - It is mainly developed for ovulation induction and offers no particular advantage to the patient
    - It has not been head-on compared with HMG, but  extra purity of FSH may not be particularly required


- Q. What is the meantime to achieving normal sperm count and fertility?
    - Mean to first sperm is 7.1 month
    - Mean to fertility is 28 months!


- Q. When is ART considered?
    - When pregnancy is not achieved within 12-24 months, ART must be considered
    - Options are Intrauterine insemination, IVF or ICSI (last option)


- Q. What is done once fertility is achieved?
    - HCG and HMG are continued till 1st trimester of pregnancy
    - After delivery, if the couple plan to conceive again, HCG is continued, and HMG is added when pregnancy is planned
    - If pregnancy is not planned again  - then shift to testosterone or continue HCG


- Q. What is done for cryptorchidism in CHH patients in infancy?
    - Surgery is done between 6-12 months of age


- Q. What is done for the micropenis?
    - Testosterone, DHT, or FSH/LH between 1-6 months of age


- Q. Can FSH given during infancy induce spermatogenesis?
    - No
    - It cannot
    - Because Sertoli cells are not affected as they do not have androgen receptors in childhood
    - Androgen receptors of Sertoli cells develop after five years of age


- Q. How is testosterone therapy initiated or maintained in a child with hypo hypo?
    - Start with a low dose of 50 mg
    - Gradually increase to full adult dose over 2 years


- Q. A child on testosterone therapy has an increase in the size of the testis. What does it indicate?
    - Testosterone does not increase the size of the testis
    - So, if the testis size has increased, it suggests a spontaneous reversal of the disease and hence stop testosterone and re-evaluate the HPG axis


- Q. Describe the GnRH pump therapy 
    - GnRH is administered 24 hours a day (even during sleeping and bathing) at 90-minute intervals through a pump with a needle, which is introduced under the skin of the abdomen (subcutaneous). The pump can also be attached via a thin hose into a vein in the lower arm (intravenous). The pump is the most significant disadvantage of the treatment.


- Q. Give the protocol for GnRH administration?
    - It is injected using a pump
    - IV is preferred to subcutaneous
    - A pulse is given every 60-90 min
    - Dose is 2.5-5 mcg per pulse
