    - Hormonal profile is done at 4-8 weeks
    - FSH is a better marker than LH
    - Undetectable FSH and Poor response to GnRH is diagnostic of IHH in infancy


- **CLINICAL PRESENTATION**


- Q. Is  IHH/C.H.H more common in males?
    - True
    - It is mainly seen in males with M: F ratio of 5:1


- Q. What is the presentation of CHH during the neonatal period?
    - Micropenis
    - Cryptorchidism


- Q. In which mutation cleft lip/cleft palate is more common?
    - FGFR1/FGF8 mutations


- Q. What is Kallmann’s syndrome?
    - Ansomsia + Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is Kallmann’s irrespective of the underlying mutation


- Q. How do CHH present in childhood?
    - Delayed puberty
    - Skeletal abnormality – Cleft lip/cleft palate
    - Anosmia


- Q. Do all patients with CHH have delayed puberty of the same variety?
    - No
    - There is a difference in presentation
    - Some have severely delayed puberty from the onset
    - Others have some pubertal development followed by the pubertal arrest
    - Some have normal puberty but have problems in adulthood with infertility- this is called adult-onset HH


- Q. Do patients with CHH have eunuchoid proportions?
    - Yes
    - It is typical


- Q. Can these patients have pubic hair?
    - Yes
    - Pubic hair is often present due to adrenarche being present- DHEA-S is usually produced normally
    - If adrenarche is also absent, think of DAX1 mutation or CDGP


- Q. What is the fertile eunuch variant of the syndrome?
    - Seminiferous tubule and testis size is normal
    - But Leydig cell function is impaired, so the Testosterone is low
    - So fertility is preserved, but testosterone is low
    - This is a fertile eunuch variant of IHH


- Q. Why is gynecomastia atypical in these patients?
    - This is because there is no FSH and LH- hence little testosterone and low testicular aromatase activity –leading to little estrogen formation


- Q. Which are the associated congenital disabilities seen in these patients?
    - Unilateral renal agenesis
    - Syndactyl
    - Cleft lip/ palate
    - Anosmia/hyposmia
    - Unilateral/bilateral cryptorchidism
    - Synkinesia (mirror movements)
    - Color vision


- Q. Which of the above are commonly seen with KAL1 mutation?
    - Unilateral renal agenesis and synkinesia are classically seen with KAL1 mutation

    - University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT)


- Q. What will be the MRI findings in these cases?
    - Pituitary will be normal
    - Small cuts 1 mm in size through the olfactory placode to look for the olfactory bulb must be done

                - •	35-100 pg/ml- Either way-more in favor of CDGP 
                - •	>100 pg/ml- CDGP for Sure 
    - 2.	GnRH agonist testing
        - LUPEROLIDE PROTOCOL (Lakhani protocol developed from Street et al.)

- **TREATMENT **


- Q. What are the treatment options for these patients?
    - Gonadal steroids
    - Human gonadotropins
    - Pulsatile GnRH


- Q. What is the disadvantage of giving gonadal steroids to these patients?
    - It impairs spermatogenesis


- Q. How is Pulsatile GnRH given?
    - It is given via a minipump that infuses GnRH every 120 min subcutaneously over the 60s
    - This matches the LH pulse, which is every 120 min
    - Starting dose is 25 ng/kg/bolus


- Q. Give the treatment protocol for CHH using HCG and HMG 
    - Step 1- Baseline investigations
        - 1.	Document Testicular volume
        - 2.	Serum testosterone
        - 3.	FSH / LH
        - 4.	Inhibin B (optional)
        - 5.	Semen analysis
    - Step 2- Start HCG
        - 1.	Inj HCG 2000 IU Intramuscularly/Subcutaneously three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
            - a.	It may be a powder that needs to reconstituted
            - 2.	Serum Testosterone monthly
            - 3.	Target testosterone to 400-800 ng/dl
            - 4.	Increase dose of HCG by 1000 IU every month if the target testosterone is not achieved
            - 5.	Once Testosterone is in target range- Sperm count every month
            - 6.	Target sperm count of 5-10 million/ml
            - 7.	If the sperm count is <5 million /ml after testosterone has been normal for 6 months, than add HMG
    - Step 3- HMG
        - 1.	In HMG 75 units INTRAMUSCULAR/Subcutenous in the same syringe as HCG start with once a week  - can be increased further if required.  
        - 2.	Monitor sperm count every 1-2 months
        - 3.	If sperm count <5 million/ml – increase dose of HMG to 150 IU


- Q. Can CHH reverse?
    - Spontaneous reversal is often seen in many patients
    - Patient on gonadotropins with normal testis size and testosterone- Gonadotropins may be stopped for 2-3 months to assess reversibility
    - Patients on gonadal steroids- stop the testosterone for 2-3 months and re-evaluate if the testis is normal in size. Testosterone will not normalize the testis size normally


- Q. What proportion of patients with CHH have a spontaneous reversal?
    - 10%


- Q. What is CHH with Cerebellar ataxia?
    - Gordon Holmes syndrome


- Q. Why do patients with CHH have no genital ambiguity?
    - This is because in the 1st trimester- the testosterone is produced by fetal Leydig cells in response to placental HCG
    - Only if there is Testosterone deficiency in 1st Trimester – there is genital ambiguity
    - Hence these patients do not have genital ambiguity


- Q. Can Kallmann be diagnosed before puberty?
    - It is sometimes diagnosed in infancy with micropenis and cryptorchidism
    - Later on, it is diagnosed in childhood with anosmia and synkinesis but suspected only if there is a family history of this syndrome


- Q. Do patients with CHH present as short stature?
    - Generally no
    - They generally have normal structural development in childhood


- Q. Why is inhibin B low in patients with CHH?
    - Inhibin B is a marker of Sertoli cell function, which in turn is dependent on FSH
    - Since FSH is low- the Sertoli cell function is impaired, and hence inhibin B is low
    - This also correlates with the testicular volume


- Q. What is the role of AMH in the diagnosis of CHH?
    - AMH marks pubertal testicular maturation
    - Because of the lack of intratesticular testosterone concentration, AMH value is also low


- Q. Which secondary cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism closely mimics CHH?
    - Primary juvenile hemochromatosis
    - Hence ferritin and Transferrin saturation must be done in all these cases


- Q. What are the role of MRI in Kallmann?
    - Rule out other etiology of  hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
    - Look for the absence of olfactory bulbs
    - Cerebellar involvement- Gordon holmes syndrome
    - Corpus callosum defects- often associated


- Q. What is the importance of doing USG in patients with Kallmann's?
    - To look for renal agenesis
    - To document exact testicular volume
    - To determine the normal anatomy of the Seminal vesicles and vas deferens


- Q. Which 2 tests in the physical examination are essential for classifying a case of hypo hypo?
    - Semiqualitative test for olfaction in the index case and family members- to look for anosmia vs. hyposmia
    - Close examination of the outer ear and hearing defect – CHARGE syndrome


- Q. What test is used for smell identification in patients with CHH?
    - University of Pennsylvania smell identification test
    - This is currently the gold standard for smell identification


- Q. What is the Indian smell test kit?
    - I-smell  test
    - This is developed by Gupta et al. of GB Pant


- Q. Which are the new biomarkers in the diagnosis and follow-up of CHH patients?
    - Kisspeptin
    - INSL3
    - Inhibin B
    - AMH


- Q. What is Oligogenecity?
    - Two or more mutations present in the same CHH patient


- Q. What is the difference between camptodactyly and clinodactyly?
    - Clinically, a bending or curvature of the finger in the plane of the palm is described as clinodactyly, a word derived from the Greek liner, “to bend,” and dactylos, “a finger.”
    - A flexion deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint is camptodactyly from the Greek “bent finger.”


- Q. Which condition presents with adrenal insufficiency before puberty and Hypo hypo during puberty?
    - AHC- Adrenal hypoplasia congenital, also called congenital X linked adrenal hypoplasia
		- This is caused by DAX1 mutation
    - Classic X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita
		- Classic X-linked AHC includes the triad of a) primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), b) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), and c) impaired fertility.
		- It has a direct effect on spermatogenesis also
		- Hence attempts to improve spermatogenesis with HCG – shows inadequate response


- Q. What is Gonadorelin?
    - It is a natural form of GnRH
