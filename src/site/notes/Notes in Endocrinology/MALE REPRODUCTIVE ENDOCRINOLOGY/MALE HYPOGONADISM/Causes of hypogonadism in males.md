- Q. What is the definition of male hypogonadism?
    - Defect in one of the two functions of the testis
        - Sperm production
        - Testosterone production


- Q. What are the two main groups of causes of hypogonadism in males? 
    -

- **Causes of primary hypogonadism in males**


- Q. What are major clinical differences between primary and secondary hypogonadism?
    - Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with defective sperm production than  Leydig cell function
    - Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with gynecomastia because of increase FSH and LH increasing the aromatase activity
    - FSH >8 IU/l is suggestive of primary hypogonadism


- Q. Enlist the causes of primary hypogonadism?
    - Congenital causes
        - Klinefelter's syndrome- most common
        - Gonadal dysgenesis
        - FSH and LH receptor defect- Leydig cell hypoplasia
        - Testosterone synthesis defect
        - Cryptorchidism
        - Congenital anorchia
        - Varicocele
        - Myotonic dystrophy
    - Acquired causes
        - infection- mump orchitis
        - HIV
        - Testicular tumor
        - Drugs – glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, other chemotherapeutic agents, ketoconazole
        - Autoimmune
        - Testicular torsion
        - Testicular trauma
        - Surgery
        - Chronic systemic disorder –CRF and CLD
        - Environmental toxins
        - Radiotherapy
        - Surgical orchidectomy


- Q. Why is the timing of testosterone defect important in congenital abnormalities of primary hypogonadism?
    - Defect in 1st trimester of pregnancy- male external genitalia would not be appropriately formed – ambiguous genitalia or female external genitalia
    - Normal Testosterone in the first trimester but defective in 3rd-trimester  micropenis at birth
    - Normal Testosterone in utero, Testosterone defect before puberty- absent secondary sexual characteristic, Eunhacnoid proportions, gynecomastia
    - Testosterone defect after puberty – normal virilization, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, reduced libido, infertility


- **Other congenital causes of Primary hypogonadism in males (other than Klinefelter syndrome) **


- Q. Which other chromosomal abnormalities are associated with primary hypogonadism in males?
    - 46 XY/XO- mixed gonadal dysgenesis
    - Yq microdeletion- azoospermia or severe oligospermia


- Q. What is [[AZF\|AZF]]?
    - AZF is a region on the long arm of chromosome Y which is associated with infertility in men
    - This produces a condition called [[Y Chromosome infertility\|Y Chromosome infertility]]
    - There are three regions - AZFa, AZFb, AZFc
    - Deletion in AZFa and AZFb produce [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|azoospermia]] 
    - Deletion in AZFc produce severe [[oligospermia\|oligospermia]] - however, enough sperms are produced for sperm extraction using [[TESE\|TESE]] and use for [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)\|Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]]


- Q. What are the features of mixed gonadal dysgenesis?
    - Patient will have a Turner like phenotype – e.g.: short stature, etc
    - Variable gonads- streak, dysgenetic or normal
    - Phenotype ranging from normal female to normal male
    - High to intermediate risk of gonadoblastoma hence gonadectomy generally advised


- Q. What does mutation in LH receptor lead to?
    - It leads to Leydig cell hypoplasia
    - This produces 46 XY DSD and ambiguous genitalia


- Q. What are the clinical features of myotonic dystrophy?
    - Muscle atrophy
    - Hypogonadism
    - Detected later in adulthood


- Q. What happens in congenital anorchia?
    - Here, the testicular regression occurs after 20 weeks
    - Hence there is normal male external genitalia but absent testis


- Q. What is [[Sertoli cell-only syndrome\|Sertoli cell-only syndrome]]?
    - This is a histological syndrome.
    - This is typically seen in young males between 20-40 years
    - On Semen analysis, they have [[Notes in Endocrinology/MALE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY/MALE INFERTILITY/Azoospermia\|azoospermia]] or severe oligospermia
    - On Histopathology- the seminiferous tubules are lined with [[Sertoli cells\|Sertoli cells]] only, and little or no spermatogenesis takes place
    - the testis may be slightly atrophied
    - [[Inhibin B\|Inhibin B]] levels may be low 
    - [[FSH\|FSH]] is elevated with normal LH
    - The male is otherwise normally virilized
    - The likely etiology is likely to be [[Y Chromosome infertility\|Y Chromosome infertility]] due to [[AZF\|AZF]] microdeletions
    - Similar situation can also be acquired due to toxins which damage the sperm production 


- **Acquired causes of primary hypogonadism**


- Q. Tell me something about mumps orchitis?
    - Hypogonadism In mumps orchitis occurs when it occurs in adulthood and not in childhood
    - There is swelling and pain of the testis followed by regression
    - Seminiferous tubule more damaged, but Leydig damage can also occur


- **Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males**


- Q. What are the features of congenital secondary hypogonadism?
    - Normal external male phenotype
    - Micropenis at birth
    - Normal growth in childhood
    - Delayed / absent puberty
    - Eunuchoid proportions


- Q. What are features of eunachoid propotions?
    - Arm spam > height by 5 cm
    - Pubis to floor > pubis to crown
    - This is because of delayed closure of epiphysis due to low testosterone and lack of estrogen


- Q. What are congenital causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism?
    - Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
    - Part of MPHD (Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies) – LHX3, LHX4, PROP1, HESX1
    - Prader Willi syndrome
    - Leptin deficiency / Leptin receptor defect
    - Mutation in LH beta and FSH beta


- Q. What are the acquired causes of secondary hypogonadism?
    - Defect at the level of Hypothalamus
        - Drugs
            - Glucocorticoids
            - GnRH analog
            - Exogenous sex steroids
        - Trauma
        - Obesity
        - Diabetes
        - Sleep apnea
        - Aging
        - Critical illness
        - Hyperprolactinemia
        - Anorexia nervosa
        - Chronic systemic illness
    - Defect at the level of the pituitary
        - Pituitary adenoma
        - Suprasellar mass
        - Pituitary apoplexy
