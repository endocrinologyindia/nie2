- Q. How common are endocrinopathies in chilhood cancer survivors ?
    - Very common
    - They are found in 40-60% of childhood cancer survivors
    - They are one of the most common late manifestations of these survivors


- Q. What are the potential reasons for endocrinopathies in them ?
    - Alkylating agents
    - Radiotherapy


- Q. Which are the most common endocrine manifestations of childhood cancer survivors ?
    - Hypopitutarism
    - Thyroid dysfunction
    - Gonadal dysfunction


- **Hypothalamo-pituitary dysfunction **


- Q. Enlist the problems in Hypothalamopituitary region in chilhood cancer survivors ?
    - Growth hormone deficiency
    - Central hypothyroidism
    - Central hypoadrenalism
    - [[Diabetes insipidus\|Diabetes insipidus]]
    - Pubertal disorder
        - Precocious puberty
        - Delayed puberty
        - Pubertal arrest 


- Q. Which cancer patients develop Hypothalamo-Pituitary dysfunction  ?
    - Surgery of sellar region
    - Cranial radiotherapy


- Q. What radiation exposure produces various pituitary defects ?
    - Radiation >18 Gy- GH deficiency and Precocious puberty
    - Radiation >30 Gy- LH,FSH, TSH and ACTH deficiency
    - Sequence of loss is GH, FSH/LH, TSH and ACTH


- Q. Does radiotherapy produce DI ?
    - No
    - It is seen with surgical intervention of sellar region


- Q. Which anticancer drug can produce DI ?
    - Temozolomide


- Q. Which is the most common Endocrinopathy following radiotherapy ?
    - Growth hormone deficiency


- Q. Is testicular volume a reliable indicator of puberty in childhood cancer survivors ?
    - No
    - Because cytotoxic drugs can cause damage to the seminiferous tubules leading to smaller size of testis


- Q. What are the pubertal issues in cancer patients ?
    - Delayed puberty
    - Precocious puberty
    - Arrest of puberty (Hypogonadotropuc hypogonadism)


- Q. Define early menarche ?
    - Menarche before age of 10 years
    #Clinicalpearl
        - Radiation dose >18 Gy- produces precocious puberty
        - Radiation dose > 30 Gy produces delayed puberty


- #Clinicalpearl
    - All these pituitary dysfunction can occur any time even years after the radiotherapy
    - Hence lifelong screening is advised


- Q. How long to screen for potential ACTH deficiency ?
    - Screening to be done with 8:00 am cortisol for upto 15 years after initial treatment in patients with childhood cancer


- **Growth disorder **


- Q. What are the causes of short stature in cancer patients ?
    - Spinal radiation – leading to damage to growth plate in spinal vertebra  spinal dysplasia
    - GH deficiency
    - Precocious puberty
    - Central hypothyroidism
    - Primary hypothyroidism
    - Use of glucocorticoids with chemotherapy


- **Thyroid disorders**


- Q. What are causes of primary hypothyroidism in cancer treated patients ?
    - Surgery of thyroid gland (thyroid cancer)
    - Radiation – to neck, mantle, total body radiation
    - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
    - Use of I-123 MIBG or other iodine labelled compounds
    - Stem cell transplant with high dose chemotherapy like buslphan or cyclophosphomide


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Hypothyrodism may occur as late at 25 years after initial treatment
    - Hence lifelong suvelliance is required


- Q. Can they develop hyperthyroidism ?
    - Yes but it is rare
    - Radiation >35 Gy to neck region can lead to hyperthyroidism due to radiation thyroiditis


- Q. What radiation dose produces risk of thyroid cancer ?
    - Risk of thyroid cancer is seen in following :
    - Radiation therapy to children <10 years and/or
    - Radiation dose of 20-29 Gy to neck
    - Radiation dose <20 Gy with alklayting agent


- Q. What about radiation dose >30 Gy ?
    - This dose generally does not produce thyroid cancer  because thyroid cells are killed by this dose


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Routine use of ultrasound for screening may cause issues because of unnecessary thyroid nodules being detected


- Q. Summarize the thyroid dysfunctions ?
    - Central hypothyroidism
    - Primary hypothyroidism
    - Hyperthyroidism
    - Thyroid cancers


- **Gonadal dysfunction  (males)**


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Germ cells – produce sperm
    - Sertoli cells- support germ cell function
    - Leydig cell – produce testosterone
    - Seminiferous tubules – combination of germ cell and Sertoli cells


- Q. What radiation dose produces Germ cell dysfunction leading to Oligo/azoospermia ?
    - Radiation dose as low as 0.15 Gy can lead to germ cell dysfunction
    - Almost all males with total body radiation develop this


- Q. Which chemotherapy agents produce germ cell dysfunction ?
    - Cyclophosphamide
    - Busulphan
    - Cisplatin


- Q. What dose of radiation produces Leydig cell dysfunction ?
    - Compared to germ cell dysfunction, leydig cell dysfunction requires considerably higher dose of radiation
    - It also depends on age- younger age- more likely to develop leydig cell dysfunction
    - In prepubertal males- dose of >24 Gy – can lead to leydig cell dysfunction


- Q. Do chemotherapeutic agents produce Leydig cell dysfunction ?
    - Generally no
    - It is very rare
    - May produce subclinical leydig cell dysfunction


- #Clinicalpearl
    - Small dose of radiotherapy and chemotherapy- can produce Germ cell dysfunction
    - Only high dose of radiotherapy produces Leydig cell dysfunction


- **Gonadal dysfunction (females)**


- Q. What dose of radiation can produce ovarian dysfunction ?
    - Radiation >10 Gy can lead to ovarian dysfunction


- **Effect on bones **


- Q. Why are these patients at a risk of Low BMD ?
    - Malignant infiltration of bones
    - GH deficiency
    - Hypogonadism
    - Sedentary life
    - Drugs – glucocorticoids and methotrextate


- **Overweight , obesity and diabetes **


- Q. What is the cause for obesity in these patients ?
    - Hypothalamic obesity- due to surgery in hypothalamic region
    - GH deficiency
    - Hypogonadism
    - Sedentary lifestyle
    - Use of glucocorticoids
