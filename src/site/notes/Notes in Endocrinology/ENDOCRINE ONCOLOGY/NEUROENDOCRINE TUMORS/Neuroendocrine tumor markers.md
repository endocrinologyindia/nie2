- Q. What is the broad classification of  Neuroendocrine tumors (NET)  ?
    - Well differentiated  Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) 
    - Poorly differentiated  Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) 
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2Fn-56kPkfuh.png?alt=media&token=45c5189a-2c5d-403c-9b09-31b9ef22b0c2)
- Q. Which are three important non-hormonal  Neuroendocrine tumor markers  ?
    -  Chromogranin A 
    - Pancreatic polypeptide
    - Pancreastatin
- Q. What is a ROC curve?
    - ROC curve spots Sensitivity on the Y axis against 1-specificity (false positive rates) in the X axis
- Q. How is the accuracy of a test determined from the ROC curve?
    - The Area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC curve represents the accuracy of a test 
    - The AUC of 1.0 is considered a perfect test
        - Greater than 0.9 is excellent
    - A AUC of 0.5 is considered a useless test -as it is 50% and likely to occur by chance

        - Arterial hypertension
        - Cardiac insufficiency/failure
        - Essential hypertension
        - Giant cell arteritis
- Q. What is another important caveat to note for patients on  Somatostatin analogs  for the treatment of  Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) ?
    - Since these agents impact the hormone activity more - the patients may have false lower values of the tumor marker
    - This may not necessarily reflect the tumor mass burden 
- Q. So in which cases the use of  Chromogranin A  is limited for a follow-up?
    - 1. Those on  Somatostatin analogues 
    - 2. Those with more localized disease
    - 3. Those with very advanced disease
- Q. Which is potentially a better marker than  Chromogranin A ?
    - Pancreastatin
    - This is derived from proteolytic cleavage of  Chromogranin A 
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMedical_learning%2FHuJ_TUV6OJ.png?alt=media&token=0aad359a-7ef8-48cd-90a1-3895e27c3873)
- Q. Why is Pancreastatin better?
    - Its level are not impacted by the use of  PPI 
    - In small studies, the levels correlate better with tumor burden 
- Q. Do current guidelines recommend the use of  Chromogranin A  as a tumor marker?
    - Most guidelines are now moving away from recommending the same tumor marker both for diagnosis and for follow-up of patients
    - It has broadly moved to become a Category III recommendation
- Q. In which patients is 5-HIAA useful as a tumor marker?
    - 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA is a useful tumor marker mainly for Midgut NET
    - Remember they are associated with  Carcinoid syndrome 
- Q. Which is the midgut NET?
    - Jejunoileal
    - Appendiceal
    - Ascending colon
- Q. What level of  gastrin  is suggestive of  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma)  ?
    -  Fasting serum gastrin should be measured in any patient suspected of having ZES.
    - ^^A serum gastrin value greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (1000 pg/mL) in the presence of a gastric pH below 2 is diagnostic of ZES^^
- Q. Can  PPI  be given to patients with  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma)  ?
    - Patients with ZES should be started on a high dose of a PPI (eg, omeprazole 40 mg twice daily, pantoprazole 80 mg twice daily). 
    - PPIs have been generally safe, even when used in high doses. 
    - Some patients require an early upward titration of these doses; however, once control of acid output has been achieved, a gradual dose reduction is usually possible
- Q. Which are other conditions causing increased gastrin levels?
    - 1. Chronic atrophic gastritis
    - 2. PPI use
    - 3. H. pylori infection
- Q. For how long should the PPI be stopped before retesting  gastrin  levels?
    - for 10-14 days
    - In such cases, patient can be shifted to a high dose of H2 blockers 
- Q. Which tumor marker is suggestive of advanced or malignant  Insulinoma ?
    -  Proinsulin  levels 
    - They are strongly suggestive of advanced insulinoma 
- Q. What is the  NETest  ?
    - This is an RNA-based test
    - This analyzes the tumor transcripts to look at the activity of the tumor 
    - This is better than  Chromogranin A 
    - It is still under evaluation- but once we understand this better- this will become the standard of care
    - This test has 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity
    - It is also useful for differentiating stable disease from progressive disease
