- Q. What is the role of Perecutenous umbilical cord sampling ? 
    - This can be done in case of leutoma 
    - This will do two thing
        - Karyotype â€“ if it is a male fetus there is no problem
        - Androgen levels in umbilical cord- more level would lead to more virilization
    - However this procedure is done at 20 weeks and by that time virlization would have already occurred 


- Q. What is the importance of umbilical cord androgen in female fetus ? 
    - High umbilical cord androgens are necessary for female fetus virilization 


- Q. What is an alternative for early diagnosis in fetus ? 
    - non invasive prenatal testing can be used 
    - This tests for cell free DNA material of fetus present in maternal blood using PCR
    - This can be used as early as 5-6 weeks of intrauterine life
